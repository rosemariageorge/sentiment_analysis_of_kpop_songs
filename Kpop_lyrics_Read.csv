Bad Day,"Under the tall street light I’m on my way back home alone Saying the lonely words, I don’t want to go… My footsteps get slower I go around the neighborhood a few times and in the end I stand in front of my house and fish for my keys I’m a loner in my noise-less room Feeling nervous, I turn up the TV volume But why are those people laughing? I hope a dark rain falls I feel someone’s body heat on the empty playground bench Why is this warmth making me feel even colder? I bury my face in my scrunched up shoulders My hands that I hid in my pockets get cold The wind is colder than yesterday so I snuggle deeper into my blankets But the wind digs in and makes me cold in every nook and cranny Outside the window, there are no signs of life, as if the lights have all turned off As I look out, I let out a meaningless breath My room is colder than the middle of winter, the air is cold even to the tips of my fingers If spring never comes, would that be better? Will the icicles in my room melt when a sunny, good day comes? Romanized:"

Blue & Grey,"Where is my angel at the end of the day someone come and save me, please A weary sigh of the day I guess everyone’s happy Can you look at me? Cuz I am blue & grey the meaning of the tears in the mirror My color hidden in laughter blue & grey I don’t know where it went wrong Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had a blue question mark inmy head. My head Maybe that’s why you’ve been living so hard But when I looked back, I found out that this is the Urduke and the suni That frosty shadow that devours me Still, the blue question mark Whether it’s anxiety or depression How can you be such an animal of regret? Or maybe it’s me who’s born of loneliness I still don’t know. Thistle blue I hope it doesn’t erode. I’ll find it exit I just wanna be happy Melt me cold My numerous hands Colorless echo Oh this ground feels so heavier I am singing by myself I just wanna be happy is this a big greed? I felt when I walked on the streets in the cold winter The fastening breath of the heart I still feel it Don’t say it’s okay ‘cause its not okay Please don’t leave me alone It hurts so much The usual walk and the ever-expression of light I am singing by myself I just wanna be happy Is this a big greed? I felt when I walked on the streets in the cold winter The fastening breath of the heart I still feel it Don’t say it’s okay ‘cause its not okay Please don’t leave me alone It hurts so much The usual walk and the ever-expression of light But today some strange scene Is it dull or is it broken? But it’s heavy, this lump of metal Approaching gray rhinoceros I’m just standing there without focus It’s not like me at this moment I’m just not scared I don’t believe in god Colorful words tickle A large gray area is convenient Here’s a glee with hundreds of millions of different Facial expressions When it rains, my world Dancing over this city It’s foggy on a clear day On wet days, we’ll always be together All the dust here Toast to I just wanna be happy Feel the warmth of my hands It’s not warm. I need you more Oh this ground feels so heavenlier I am singing by myself In the distant future, when I smile I’ll tell you. I did"

Your innocent eyes don’t tell me Not to go home Instead, it’s like you’re looking at a scary beast You look at me with pure deer-like eyes You look at me and say Let’s meet tomorrow at this time It’s time for us to say goodbye It’s time for me to take you home This time to separate comes every day without fail Don’t turn around and hurry home before I change Before the wolf in me awakens Before the full moon rises Before the full moon rises I think it’s even brighter today That moon is shining on me On this night I’m letting you go It is so beautiful It’s time for us to say goodbye It’s time for me to take you home This time to separate comes every day without fail Don’t turn around and hurry home before I change Before the wolf in me awakens"
GOT7 – Confession Song Lyrics,"Hundreds of confessions without success I feel so unconfident should I just go back I say I’ll confess for sure but it’s pointless with no actions in the end Can’t keep my head up in front of you I’m in love with you, why are these words so hard I keep hesitating to say over and over again Why is it so hard just to write a simple letter I keep writing and tearing it over and over again You may not feel the same way as I do I may never see you again, that’s what I’m afraid of Don’t have the courage to tell you With this song let me open my heart to you I love you, baby I, I love you (for a very long time) I love you, baby I, I love you All day long I wait for your reply I keep writing and erasing to make sure there’s no mistake in my words I accidentally say things that I don’t mean The dramatic lines that I practiced in front of the mirror Are all forgotten when I stand in front of you, flustering me My hands hesitate in front of yours My heartbeat sound getting louder, you might hear it yeah You may not feel the same way as I do I may never see you again, that’s what I’m afraid of Don’t have the courage to tell you With this song let me open my heart to you I love you, baby I, I love you (for a very long time) I love you, baby I, I love you My heart beats like a DRUM My arms just wait for the day to hug you tight My calendar just waits for the day marked red My confession just waits for my courage Though I am still a timid fool I hope this song I wrote for countless nights Deliver my sincerity Take one side of the earphone in your hand Shall we? I love you, baby I, I love you (for a very long time) I love you, baby I, I love you"

GOT7 – If You Do Lyrics,"If you do it’s GOOD, if I do it’s DONE How can you always say that I’m wrong You always want to win Tears are your ultimate weapon I was attracted to your confidence at first But every day I went down on my knees You magnified even my minor mistakes And pushed me to the edge of the cliff Well I love you anyway, that’s why I put up with you Every day every night feel like a fool You gotta know Why why why are you always mad mad mad at me Can we go back to the way we were If you do it always becomes the right words If you do I can never win Suddenly you become a different person When we get along well I get more nervous If I do If I do If I say something you always say let’s break up So I can’t get any closer Can’t deepen my love for you Your major is saying the same thing over and over You force me to do things to please you I am tired of these trials with already known results I’m desperate to break free To you they’re just friends To me they’re jerks who could be flirting with you Another mistake, if you do it’s ok, but if I do huh I wish you wouldn’t go too far but you just can’t stop Now I say in my sleep, I’ll be good When there’s nothing to say you always say, I’m gonna go to bed Frustrated with no one to talk to Sometimes I delude myself that I’m trapped If you do it always becomes the right words If you do I can never win Suddenly you become a different person When we get along well I get more nervous If I do If I do If I say something you always say let’s break up So I can’t get any closer Can’t deepen my love for you Every day every night feel like a fool You gotta know Why why why are you always mad mad mad at me Can we go back to the way we were If you do it always becomes the right words If you do I can never win Suddenly you become a different person When we get along well I get more nervous If I do If I do If I say something you always say let’s break up So I can’t get any closer Can’t deepen my love for you"

GOT7 – My Reaction Lyrics,"Every single cell in my body reacts From my head to my toes, everything reacts It was my first time, feeling that way I’ve never felt it before So I quickly fell for you I know that the sweeter it is, the more dangerous The more dangerous it is, the sweeter it is But I didn’t wanna lose you But my prediction was exactly right You changed in just one moment You used my innocent heart You played me like a doll Throwing me away when you got sick of me I hated you so much for that but My eyes react, my ears react When I see you, when I hear your voice My entire body reacts, it reacts first I really don’t want to but what do I do? I can’t control myself No no no no no no no no Every single cell in my body reacts From my head to my toes, everything reacts No no no no no no no no Every corner of my body reacts When I see you, it automatically reacts But I still had that small belief that you will love me So even when I gave you my all, it didn’t feel wasteful But the more time passed, the more bold and indifferent you became So you gave me a deeper scar and I was in even more pain My eyes react, my ears react When I see you, when I hear your voice My entire body reacts, it reacts first I really don’t want to but what do I do? I can’t control myself No no no no no no no no Every single cell in my body reacts From my head to my toes, everything reacts No no no no no no no no Every corner of my body reacts When I see you, it automatically reacts When I knew it was a trap, it was already too late I tried so hard but I couldn’t escape It’s too late, I’m slowly sinking But as if you’re ridiculing me, the poison in my body keeps spreading What do I do? But why do I like this trap? Oh my, and why is this poison so sweet? Is it that I can’t escape or that I don’t want to? I don’t know either, I just like you so much My entire body reacts, it reacts first When I see you, when I hear your voice It keeps reacting, it reacts again I really don’t want to but what do I do? I can’t control myself"

Life Goes On,"One day the world stopped Without any warning Spring didn’t know to wait Showed up not even a minute late Streets erased of footprints I lie here, fallen to the ground Time goes by on its own Without a single apology It looks like rain again today I’m soaked to the bone Still won’t stop Running faster than that cloud of rain thought that’d be enough Guess I’m only human after all I’m in a world of pain This cold the world gave to me Prompts me to press the dust-covered rewind dancing off-beat lying on the ground Once winter comes, let’s exhale A warmer breath There’s no end in sight Is there a way out? My feet refuse to move oh Close your eyes for a moment Hold my hand To that future, let’s run away Like an echo in the forest The day will come back around As if nothing happened Yeah life goes on Like an arrow in the blue sky Another day flying by On my pillow, on my table Yeah life goes on Like this again Let me tell you with this song People say the world has changed But thankfully between you and me Nothing’s changed With the “annyeong” that we start and finish the day Let us thread tomorrow with today Stopped for now but don’t hide in the shadow Once again daylight will glow There’s no end in sight Is there a way out? My feet refuse to move oh Close your eyes for a moment Hold my hand To that future, let’s run away Like an echo in the forest The day will come back around As if nothing happened Yeah life goes on Like an arrow in the blue sky Another day flying by On my pillow, on my table Yeah life goes on Like this again I remember I remember I remember I remember"

As the days pile up, we get further away I don’t think I can reconcile with myself I don’t think it’s gonna get any better When I was young, there was an endless sea in my heart That I was never able to hide Now in the faintest places, only traces remain The sound of my breath that was filled with excitement And the breeze blowing above my head I want to become a wave and run anywhere Being a little scared, I slowly open my eyes The world comes to me at every moment And it becomes a dazzling gift I have a big number of doubts But I think I can find the answer to them The memories are calling me from the other side With the voice I had forgotten for a long time I go back to being against the waves In the place where the sea inside me was born Even if I get swept away and get lost, I’m free I don’t close my eyes to the darkness that locks me up anymore I won’t pretend I don’t know myself again But still sometimes There will be days in which I’ll lose against life Even if get lost again, I know my way back Romanized:"

Sogyeokdong,"Strolling lonesomely down the narrow alley stairway that you and I used to stroll down together, the deep fragrance of the past brushes past me. The day you went away, actually I… Lights, icicles hanging on the eaves and the sound of sparrows I want to stay in this beautiful village. Do you remember Sogyeokdong It still remains the same today. White flurries of snow late at night. As the layers of white pile up, my heart flutters with anticipation. I didn’t get a wink of sleep that night. I couldn’t fall asleep, thinking that if I opened my eyes again, all this would vanish before me. One day, when the stream suddenly dried up, my young heart died just like the water in the stream. I remember everything about you. Small moments in a day would make my day. Then one day, my world turned upside down. Cherish what you have now, for it could vanish in an instant. I don’t want to forget about this, but I don’t even have a single photo left. I just keep telling myself that I’ve done all I could."

You Never Know,"On the days I force myself to smile brightly Why is the night even darker?
