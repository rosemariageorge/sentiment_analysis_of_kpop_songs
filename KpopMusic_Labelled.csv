If there was a practice in love (Prod. 2Soo),"If there was a practice in love
Is we different
The time I met or that place
If the situation was different

Was it so pretty
A good woman like you
Why do you meet me
I gave it to me excessive love
Let's go back then
Is that crazy
Crazy
I can do better
It won't ring again
I'm confident, but why doesn't it make sense
I learned too much of the time
How to save you without ringing

Without waiting
It's time to see if it flows

To him who meets you now
Like I did to me
Do you smile pretty
A good woman like you

Each other was amazing

I put the moonlight in my eyes at once
Every Time I Look Up in the Sky
But without a single star
I won't leave it alone
Make me not lonely
You're looking at the stars and dragging my hands
Sit on the roof of the evening
Every Time I Look Up in the Sky

If you comfort you, I'll catch the pen
Rather than stimulating
I can say sincerely
All day

Every time I make it heavy
I don't have a hand to comfort you

You are the power to pull me
You wander around like a sky that lost the stars
Like the last way, like the constellation
Follow me and you along the way

Imagine her reaction
I was humming to call you better

It is the reason of natural practice
The flying birds
All singing love songs
If you only open something likely
But there was a boyfriend
It's my mistake

I had a complicated heart

So karaoke becomes a hobby

So after I called
I'm trying to go home by chance
Suddenly she will go to karaoke

I am not

I don't do anything now

My last words I couldn't do to you,"Is it still left
Is there a reason to forget
Why only me like this
Should I wait for you alone like a fool
The windy winds
Your words that are ridiculous
It makes me want to believe it again
I know it's not different, but I know it's the end
I think and that all
Maybe I want to say to you
Long night
I still love you a lot
I hope this painful time passes by
I'll hold it a little bit more
The day without you
See you want to see
I'll forget it one a day
Every day, I made this commitment every day like a habit
Longer
On days when longing gets used to
It's quite funny, but it's okay again

I want to see more because I say this
Even if you are looking at your picture
miss you
Too fast time
I hate us
Even if you look at your face now
We are hard
This is only winter
In August, winter comes
My heart runs time
Solo Snow Country Train
Hold your hand and go to the other side of the earth
I finished the winter
How longing are
Should the spring day come when you get off like snow?
Friend
Floating
Like a small dust like a small dust
If the flying snow is
A little faster
It would be possible to reach you
Snowflakes fall
It's a little far away
I miss you to see
I miss you to see
How long to wait
I have to stay up a few more nights
Will you see you or see you?
Will you meet or meet
Passing through the cold winter
Until the spring day comes again
Until blossoms
Give me a little more there
Stay
Whether you have changed
Whether you have changed
Or am I changing
I have changed
I hate even the time flowing at this moment
We have changed
Everyone is like that
Yes, you hate you, but you have left
Just one day
I never forgotten
Honestly I want to see
I'll erase you
That's rather than resentment
Because it hurts less
Blow it
Like white smoke like smoke
Even if it is erased in words
In fact, I haven't sent you yet
Snowflakes fall
It's a little far away
I miss you to see
I miss you to see
How long to wait
I have to stay up a few more nights
Will you see you or see you?
Will you meet or meet
You know it all
You 'My Best Friend
The morning will come again
No darkness
I can't be forever
Cherry blossoms are bloody
This winter is over
I miss you to see
I miss you to see
If you wait a little
If you just shrine for a few nights
I'll go to meet you
I'll pick you up and pick it up

Sometimes when I take a break

Memories
When you use someone again
Only then
I became your music
Yes I am for someone
Winter for someone in spring
For someone, the first to someone
I am fascinated by someone who is happy to someone
For someone, it's a lullaby
Sometimes noise

Pretend to laugh

After many days
It will be forgotten
Living again
I love someone to go like that
The road to parting
It is also clear
The way to take you off
Without any notice
Suddenly, to parting
I don't know much hard, I'm sorry
Lie not to love again
While leaving you crying back
I'm cold
Hello now
I'd rather hate me
You can't even get angry
Too easy to throw
That means that remains in my heart
I regret not saying that I was sorry

I guess the sky is depressed
After the rain stops
This time I think I'm crying
Strumming Down to My Memories
In the stiff radio
Another obvious love song
A painful excitement I forgot
Make you remind you
On our walk
The melody that came out
I was humming, where are you
The sky is so clear
My heart wet in the rain
You who were warmly shining
It's sunny for me
So why did I send it
Good Bye
So hard to Lose But Easy to Repeat
Did you find out your face
I'm losing my Breathe
The sick memories I wanted to forget
Make me harder
I don't even know how to go
Many nights and love songs
It was sweeter than a dream
I didn't give up easily
The moment you encountered a coincidence
I turned back in that I might be caught my heart
If you caught you
Why did I send you like that
On our walk
The melody that came out
I was humming, where are you

Goodbye,"Look at the afternoon moving away
Thinking when I passed by
You on the corner of the memory
Be here now
Now in the screen that has stopped
You are laughing at me like summer
Maybe this is the last time

What was this difficult?

Like hide and seek where you play a very young day
I left alone so that the sun goes down
Be here now

You are laughing at me like summer

Alcohol (Feat. Crush),"The shaking leg

I will Never be Okay

Sweet alcohol today
I can't do this
Try to erase you
This is not broken
The body and mind that only you knew
Initialization to make new flesh
It's just a transformation that changes the season
Take off you and become naked
Wounded and struggling
Like mixing alcohol
Mix the poison with poison
I want to be detoxified
What's new
It's harmful but so is love
Traces of flower paths
How to see a thorny road
By the time the fog of the cigarette
I'm wake up
By the time of crashing and hitting the bottom
I'm ll wake up
It's hard to save you
Break Up to sleep
You can be in vain in front of you
Imma drink up

My head is round and round
Erasing you
Is it a habit
I do not disinfect with alcohol every night
Bain's heart that bleeds
I have to fall asleep when I break the film
If you wake up and repeat it
Ending scenes are my daily life
That moon in Seoul's sky
As if you were alone
I keep it alone
The living room where only darkness is left
The traces you left
I deleted it all over the house
I can't let go of my hands yet
perhaps
After removing the toughness that was tougher than eternity
I guess only the alcohol remains
I shed tears in a drink
Laugh like a crazy guy
Come on, follow the poison overflowing
I try to do this
Hardly
Try to erase you
Like a fool
It's all broken
Maybe you
I can't sleep
Yes, or
Write a breakup

Beautiful and hurts,"Meet love and say goodbye
I cried and laughed countless days
Time is a moment
Beautiful and hurts
It's almost like a body that lost a romantic poet
Vague reiteration
Meet another pain to avoid the pain
Didn't you find the happiness next to you?
How long after sending you
I don't know if I regret it a lot
A lot of things at this moment
I'm missing
The time passed again and came here
Even now, it will remain as a memory
I'm afraid to start again
I might meet a farewell
Meet love and say goodbye
I cried and laughed countless days
Time is a moment
Beautiful and hurts
Yeah Love Then Love Then Pain
Yeah let's learn from our Mistakes
We grow from failure
Grow up
I want to love
Nobody Wants to Deal
with the pain that follows NO
I understand them though
YEAH understands to be understood
Love
What made me laugh every day
Now it bothers you every day
In pain
There will be no pain, but
Wounds are eternal
But that 'Why it's called
Beautiful Pain
Time doesn't wait sadly
It will be yesterday after all today
Starting again
It's so hard
I think it's going to end
Meet love and say goodbye
I cried and laughed countless days
Time is a moment
Beautiful and hurts
I can't stop love
The pain is repeated
It's sick like this, but come again
Love secrets
Everyone is a fool
In helplessly, in a moment
As if I waited for a long time
In front of a painful love
Meet you and love
I was happier than any other moment
Don't be sick
I hope it was beautiful

We don't talk together (Feat. Giriboy) (Prod. SUGA),"Do you feel the same now
It's weird
This night walking after a long time
Even if a little awkward
I'm still yours
I'm sorry I
Really not feared
I Don't Know I Don't Know
Maybe then then
I believe you will soothe me
It's long
You disappear
Everything collapsed
Perhaps with a dazed look
I built a house
I'm getting heavier
I can't walk
I can't send you like this
I can't fall off my mouth
I know
Because we love
We don't talk together
I'm still you
Why don't you
I don't want to admit it
Why don't you
I can't send it
We love so much
No because I love
I was so aware of reality
Time is coming
I have to send you
Right turn left
Ghost
Oh, I will turn it back
The breakup hurts so much
I'll let you go
No, I don't want to let you go
You can treat it

The night that reminds me of a pretty face that was just good
You who always matched me

The expression is still clear
Look at me again
Your long struggle
I'll listen to it all
Still not kept

You are by my side again

I sell it elsewhere because I don't do it
If you don't know humility, hell is deep
Because it's short life, listen to your brother
Gigki Papa's smart popularity
Not entertaining like a slinky
Don't stop believing
Keep on Following
What you'Re Dreaming
I didn't hide
I don't bite
Because I followed up to my ear
Still, I'm going to smile

Crazy angle of emotion and shouts
Why do you want to be irritating

wanna be loved same love as you
baby i want it

on every picture you post
a guy i've never seen before likes it... who is he?
oh right i'm not your boyfriend anymore
i somehow naturally typed out your phone number
but calling or texting you is like losing
if i don't say anything
i don't think you'll even care about me
why isn't there a dislike button
i don't like becoming one of those thirty likes from here and likes from there
saying ""let's meet up once"" and ""oh why are you so pretty""
uh f**k that all stupid b*******s
you're not even mine anymore but why do i feel like you're being taken away
haha you're living fine without me
i don't wanna see it so stop partying so hard
i swallow the curses that rose up to my throat

trainee
in many ways, this term defines my existence
but at the same time it is a term that i can never truly explain
a period of time, a state of transition
where i could neither belong anywhere
nor do anything
the biggest concerns i had living as a trainee
were the questions of friends and family
""when are you going to come out?""
""when are you going to debut?""
questions like these
i couldnat give them an answer
because i didnat know either
because such answers were unknowable
though i came here through a certain confidence
and belief in myself
what awaited me was a different kind of reality:
even now, after three years have passed
even as i occasionally gain the self-certainty to think things like
aonce i debut, i will conquer the music industrya
whenever i hear the criticisms of the producers and teachers
i am again overwhelmed by the realization that i am nothing
that i am as inconsequential as a speck of dust
itas as if though before me lies the bluest ocean
and if i turn to look back
a vast desert awaits me
in this hourglass-like mindset
in this mood
i spent my three years as a trainee
and now, my debut is finally drawing near
even after i debut
new oceans and new deserts will likely await me
i am not afraid
because what has made me who i am
are the oceans and deserts i have witnessed until this moment
i will never forget
the oceans and deserts i have seen
because i am a trainee",en,ahah trainee in many ways this term defines my existence but at the same time it is a term that i can never truly explain a period of time a state of transition where i could neither belong anywhere nor do anything the biggest concerns i had living as a trainee were the questions of friends and family when are you going to come out when are you going to debut questions like these i couldnat give them an answer because i didnat know either because such answers were unknowable though i came here through a certain confidence and belief in myself what awaited me was a different kind of reality even now after three years have passed even as i occasionally gain the selfcertainty to think things like aonce i debut i will conquer the music industrya whenever i hear the criticisms of the producers and teachers i am again overwhelmed by the realization that i am nothing that i am as inconsequential as a speck of dust itas as if though before me lies the bluest ocean and if i turn to look back a vast desert awaits me in this hourglasslike mindset in this mood i spent my three years as a trainee and now my debut is finally drawing near even after i debut new oceans and new deserts will likely await me i am not afraid because what has made me who i am are the oceans and deserts i have witnessed until this moment i will never forget the oceans and deserts i have seen because i am a trainee,ahah trainee many ways term defines existence time term never truly explain period time state transition could neither belong anywhere anything biggest concerns living trainee questions friends family going come going debut questions like couldnat give answer didnat either answers unknowable though came certain confidence belief awaited different kind reality even three years passed even occasionally gain selfcertainty think things like aonce debut conquer music industrya whenever hear criticisms producers teachers overwhelmed realization nothing inconsequential speck dust itas though lies bluest ocean turn look back vast desert awaits hourglasslike mindset mood spent three years trainee debut finally drawing near even debut new oceans new deserts likely await afraid made oceans deserts witnessed moment never forget oceans deserts seen trainee,"{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.755, 'pos': 0.186, 'compound': 0.9368}",0.9368,Positive
Road/Path,"yeah, wassup
you know, time flows like stars
(check it, check, check, check, check it out)

it started with eminem, garion, epik high
i exceed imitation, i write my own rap then carve them in
somehow found myself at hongdae already
back then, my lyrics were all (****) stubborn old
but we dunno, we dunno, we dunno the future
allowed no time to breathe and tied me up while i was dreaming
the trap of an abandoned reality, oh the trap of oneas youth
my fiery heart lost to my cold head (damn)
while i had blind faith that my choice was the right one
something that i canat identify as an angel or devil says
awouldnat you like to rap properly?
yes or no, there is no time to hesitatea
i, who didnat want to make an even bigger idiot out of myself
came to this place and 3 years have since passed
some say art is long, life is short
but now for me, art is life
life is sports
just do it, uh

would i have changed?
if i had chosen a different path
if i had stopped and looked back
oh hey ya, hey ya
what will i get to see?
at the end of this road
where you would be standing
oh hey ya, hey ya

countless measures of time have passed and itas 2013
i remained a trainee for 3 years
iave changed from a high school student
became an adult child, without knowing
grey hairs of greed and ambition increase
and the many friends i had split off one by one
lonely without family
i greet my third spring in seoul alone
i thought my worries will ease with the debut in front of my nose
i closed my eyes to the present that could not be altered
reality was different, even when my peers tried to help me
i walked the lightless tunnels on my own
i thought i was alone but iave learned that we are seven
no longer barefoot, wearing shoes called bangtan
we go on forward another step, newer than the last
towards the fourth spring, weall greet in seoul, woah

would i have changed?
if i had chosen a different path
if i had stopped and looked back
oh hey ya, hey ya
what will i get to see?
at the end of this road, where you would be standing
oh hey ya, hey ya

itas the year 2010
my steps head to seoul
i, who started out just loving dance
is soon to stand on stage
until then i combat the many pains and scars and prepare myself
i nurture my notion to bend rather than to break
and run for 3 years
and ignite the stars in my heart
now see me anew
i carve abangtana into a blank page that means the whole world
i walk towards my brighter future
i put on a smile for the further days, ha ha

would i have changed?
if i had chosen a different path
if i had stopped and looked back
oh hey ya, hey ya
what will i get to see?
at the end of this road, where you would be standing
oh hey ya, hey ya

BTS, we dropped the second ball
CS, the revolution started again

a good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?
in seoul to the sky, would your parents be happy?

dream is gone, no time to breathe
school, house and pc room is all we have
we live the same life
and have to become number one
for us it's like a double spy between dream and reality

who is the one who made us into study machines?
it's either number one or a failure
they trap us in borders, the adults
thereas no choice but to consent
even if we think simply, itas the survival of the fittest
who do you think is the one who makes us step on even our close friends to climb up? what?

adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
to endure a little more, to do it later

everybody say no!
it's not going to work anymore
don't be captured in others dreams
we roll (we roll) we roll (we roll) we roll
everybody say no!
it has to be now
we've done nothing yet
we roll (we roll) we roll (we roll) we roll
everybody say no!

in seoul to the sky, would your parents be happy?

i want to eat and have fun, i want to tear my uniform
make money, good money, but they already view me crookedly
my obscure bank account, my unhappiness is past its limit
a factory of sighs while studying, a continuous cycle

adults say that we have it so easy
they say i'm on my way to happiness
then how do you explain my unhappiness?
there's no conversation topics other than studying
outside, there are so many kids like me, living the life of a puppet
who will take responsibility?

adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
to endure a little more, to do it later

everybody say no!
it's not going to work anymore
don't be captured in others dreams
we roll (we roll) we roll (we roll) we roll
everybody say no!
it has to be now
we've done nothing yet
we roll (we roll) we roll (we roll) we roll
everybody say no!

everybody say no!
everybody say no!
everybody say no!

your breathtaking neck when you
put it up and the strands that fall out
wherever we go
my handbag is your waist
yo ma honey
whenever i see you i run out of breath like the streets of myungdong
our bgm is the sound of breathing
your voice when you say my name
i wanna be locked in you and swim in you
i want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
i appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
i imagine this all night every day
because itas a meaningless dream anyway

out of all those words i had to swallow
because of the excuse of reality
iall pick one and tell it to you for sure
letas meet when the morning glory blooms
and part when they wither

you are standing in the center of my life

every single day is a repetition of ctrl+c, ctrl+v
i have a long way to go but why am i running in place?
i scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
i hope tomorrow will be different from today
iam just wishing

donat get too far away, tomorrow

donat get far away, tomorrow

the tomorrow weave been waiting for
becomes the name of yesterday at some point
tomorrow becomes today, today becomes yesterday
tomorrow becomes yesterday and is behind me
life isnat about living along but living through
as you live through, youall disappear some day
if you keep spacing out, youall be swept away
if you ainat no got the guts, trust
itall all become yesterday anyway so whatas the use?
i wanted to become happy and strong but why am i getting weaker?
where am i going? iam going here and there but i always come back here
yeah, iall probably flow somewhere, is there an end to this maze?
i have a long way to go but why am i running in place?

don't need long explanations, just explain with a rap
bts, follow the leader, let's go now

i'm a rap wiper, a complete psycho, if i'm a dicer, then i have all the dice
cypher, if you're nice, i'm nicer
if you're pride, then i'm a chrysler, that means i'mma priceless
who are you to judge my rap? rapper?
this is one piece, i'm a whitebeard, you just have long beards like catfish, bucket
hehe haha, honk honk, 300 per hour
i'm going through the process of working hard
i won't discriminate but catch them all, tombstone, knock knock knock out
fire in the hole beat bing bing pow pow, you'll cry and look for your dad
my voice constricts the voices of the plain rappers at all times, like the pc cafe closing
this is a kingdom, i'm a king, you're dumb
i'm chew you and swallow, you're bubblegum
on top of the running man is the flying man
on top of the flying man is the one who rides on him
that's me, beat, a badder guy than rain
like rags, i just hang it up, after i play with it, i rip up your eardrums, boom boom boom
this is the curse of my dawn, a nightmare, a riot, serial murder, theft, doom doom doom
you're like a kakaotalk with no friends, no reason to look
did you already wet your pants? sorry, there's no bathroom
i'm commanding you, let go of the mic and get up
just do the ""chun"" because you have no ""shil""
i'll push you out because i really don't like you
i'm good at sewing, putting it into practice
i'm growling right now, you're in a bit of danger
just do the ""yeon,"" like i said, you have no ""shil""
rise and rise to the sky but get ripped, bucket, i've forgotten you
my voice, my hegemony, i made it from one to ten
i put the whole world on my tongue
i play with big boys, i ain't spittin low sh
on the cd or the tv, you can see me, envy me, it's a pity, gee gee
beat i'mma monster i rap with a prospect, yeah i rap with a mindset i'm a suspect
sucka where yo rhymes at where you lines at? i'm da king, i'm the god so where ma emperors at?
i parachute on my neverland, i'mma peter pan, so this will never end
you know when i ride on my g5 you sit first class and satisfy and i keep giggling
keep gigglin, keep jigglin, bring yo booking mic beat, wanna have a go?
hyungs who are sick with pride and strange beliefs get lost after 8 measures
you old catepillars, i'll give you this beat, give it a try
hey, start talking when you can start rapping
there should be a law restricting you from rapping

because of who? because of j-hope
because of who? because of rap mon
again, because of who? because of suga
us three gather together and shout out a new generation
because of j-hope
because of who? because of j-hope
because of who? because of rap mon
again, because of who? because of suga
the next batter will rap on top of this beat

speech and action are like shackles, my crime is assault with my tongue
you're so bad ever since you were born
if you're gonna whine about this beat, just leave
look at the arrogance of the hip-hop con artists
when you were playing underground, bts was playing at ground level
compared to you who sleeps all night, i'm a workaholic, shoppaholic
overspending on my pens that are more in number than your fans, if i go all in and shoot, it's a goal in
goal in, i'm ballin, when i hear your rap, i'm about to throw up
my voice even bewitches your girlfriend
the studio is my playground, my partner is a pen and paper
you think being escorted makes you powerful, i hope you put down your mic
if i'm the sun, you're the moon, because when i rise, you go down
all you hip-hip designer brand bastards, come down from the foamy bubbles
hey you brats, your crappy rap is a burden to others
take a break and wait, just go to hawaii, go home
see how far i go, all the rotten roots will be replaced
everyone, let's play a game, without efforts, you'll just be grieving
you think you can do music? just go look for a part-time job
although your short and thin career will get you nowhere
i hope you survive, keep rotting away, that's your label
your life is like a mudfish, your rap is recycled
you save up and divide up the flow, write it up and use it again
hey beat, know that you're embarrassing, just with 24 measures, you lay down sick
compared to your size, your rap is so thin
like your parents, my heart hurts every time i see you
i'll put a period at the artery of your music career",en,because of who because of jhope because of who because of rap mon again because of who because of suga all of the style and flow is because of

you know bts is back!

with shoes worth a couple hundred, padded jacket worth a couple thousand
with a watch worth a couple hundred you feel good about yourself
education goes over the hill and student identity goes over the hill too
the class system of the 21st century is divided into two
those who have and those who havenat
those who wear the shoes and those who donat
those who have the clothes and those who donat
and those who try hard to get those things
whatas going on? are you falling behind on the trend?
you whined and complained to get it, did i strike a nerve?
in your padded jacket, your greed fills it up
even after seeing your parentsa curved spines, youare so coldhearted
you complain that all your friends have it and that they should buy it for you
(ayo baby) stop being so immature
you wonat freeze just because you donat have that jacket
fill your head with good sense before itas too late

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
youare something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
what is wrong with you? youare crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

iam saying iall spend my own money that i received

please go take care of yourself
itas about your life, if you were me, i wouldnat say anything
yeah, my jacket is really expensive and not pretty at all
(but i say) i really want it so what do i do?
friends who are poorer than me have it too
(and i say) i have no choice but to buy it if i donat wanna be an outcast
people my age are all like this
yeah i dunno, yes iam loco, is it no-no?
i know they ainat cheap but they got mojos

youare something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong
what is wrong with you? youare crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

dirty clothes for you, dirty clothes for me
everyone experienced it before
wearing expensive clothes and walking on the street, feeling good about yourself
everyone looks smaller than me like iam gulliver
whatever you wear, i understand but youare too much
youare gonna regret it
you can keep your swag on but how about your parents?
fine, i wonat stop you but make a decision now

2007 is when my life changed
itas been 7 years since iave sang
a killer of girlsa hearts
but sometimes, i go back to those frustrating times
facing myself, who was like a white piece of paper
that encounter awakens a different me
now iall go up on stage
and surprise everyone by jumping like jordan
ball!
go back a few years
taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air
you used to feel the joy of each jump, feeling like you have everything
letting myself go to the innocent dreams
my childhood days was impatient to be an adult
but each day was filled with joy
so can i be the one, just can i be the one
that i... stop

now jump to the stage, we are the new generation heroes
seven heroes-in-training, who were once immature, making a jump sound
instead of a trampoline, the place i need to jump on is the stage, crazily, up down

on every picture you post
a guy i've never seen before likes it... who is he?
oh right i'm not your boyfriend anymore
i somehow naturally typed out your phone number
but calling or texting you is like losing
if i don't say anything
i don't think you'll even care about me
why isn't there a dislike button
i don't like becoming one of those thirty likes from here and likes from there
saying ""let's meet up once"" and ""oh why are you so pretty""
uh f**k that all stupid b*******s
you're not even mine anymore but why do i feel like you're being taken away
haha you're living fine without me
i don't wanna see it so stop partying so hard
i swallow the curses that rose up to my throat
and again today i press the like button, shit

baby, i want it

my friend clicked like on your photo
and i see that your face looks much better
you tag tag a photo with your new boyfriend
through that i'm backspace-ing into the memories
in that world everything has stopped
so why am i still stuck in those times?
do you think of me, do you?
i contemplate if i should click like or not
it repeats many times
your heart is like a guillotine
cutting me mercilessly
but, like a goblin, i secretly go to you
and watch your daily life
each time i am tormented
oh shit, do you think of me, do you?
as i contemplate, i decide not to click like

after we broke up you look better, pretty woman

i want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
if thereas a chance in my busy schedule
i want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
i like that, your long, straight hair
your breathtaking neck when you
put it up and the strands that fall out
wherever we go
my handbag is your waist
yo ma honey
whenever i see you i run out of breath like the streets of myungdong
our bgm is the sound of breathing
your voice when you say my name
i wanna be locked in you and swim in you
i want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
i appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
i imagine this all night every day
because itas a meaningless dream anyway

but still, if you see me someday, smile
maybe you resent me a little or no, a lot
i know, i couldnat look at you more because of my dream
then just give me one day
even if itas in my dream, just one day
out of all those words i had to swallow
because of the excuse of reality
iall pick one and tell it to you for sure
letas meet when the morning glory blooms
and part when they wither
i didnat think iad get over you easily but
is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
iam still lying, saying that itas all for you
you are standing in the center of my life

just one day, if i can be with you
just one day, if i can hold your hands
just one day, if i can be with you

my life is in between
jobless twenty-somethings are afraid of tomorrow
itas funny, you think anything is possible when youare a kid
when you feel how hard it is to get through a day
i keep feeling down like control beat gets downed
every single day is a repetition of ctrl+c, ctrl+v
i have a long way to go but why am i running in place?
i scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
i hope tomorrow will be different from today
iam just wishing

even if it breaks down, oh better
follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, donat ever run backwards, never

because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
wherever you are right now, youare just taking a break

wherever you are right now, youare just taking a break
donat give up, you know
donat get too far away, tomorrow

tomorrow, keep walking, weare too young to stop
tomorrow, open the door, we see too much to shut the door
when the dark night passes, a bright morning will come
when tomorrow comes, the bright light will shine so donat worry
this isnat a stop but just a pause in your life for a break
turn up your thumbs and press play so everyone can see

BTS Cypher PT. 2 : Triptych ,"because of who? because of j-hope
because of who? because of rap mon
again, because of who? because of suga
all of the style and flow is because of bangtan

the kids who will lead the 21st century hallyu has started to play
we're seven wolves, gathering the lambs with a trap
we pull through all the broken rap from now on
we keep driving forward, giants on the beats
bangtan cypher right here, psycho right here
whoever's in the ring, we'll win, rap fighter right here
i'll say hi, you'll say bye, a burnt tire, we're different
fire, hot choir, captivating k-pop like psy
my rap is huge, i'll say right in your ear, bug that
our riots got successively stronger
don't need long explanations, just explain with a rap
bts, follow the leader, let's go now
what

i'm a rap wiper, a complete psycho, if i'm a dicer, then i have all the dice
cypher, if you're nice, i'm nicer
if you're pride, then i'm a chrysler, that means i'mma priceless
who are you to judge my rap? rapper?
this is one piece, i'm a whitebeard, you just have long beards like catfish, bucket
hehe haha, honk honk, 300 per hour
i'm going through the process of working hard
i won't discriminate but catch them all, tombstone, knock knock knock out
fire in the hole beat bing bing pow pow, you'll cry and look for your dad
my voice constricts the voices of the plain rappers at all times, like the pc cafe closing
this is a kingdom, i'm a king, you're dumb
i'm chew you and swallow, you're bubblegum
on top of the running man is the flying man
on top of the flying man is the one who rides on him
that's me, beat, a badder guy than rain
like rags, i just hang it up, after i play with it, i rip up your eardrums, boom boom boom
this is the curse of my dawn, a nightmare, a riot, serial murder, theft, doom doom doom
you're like a kakaotalk with no friends, no reason to look
did you already wet your pants? sorry, there's no bathroom
i'm commanding you, let go of the mic and get up
just do the ""chun"" because you have no ""shil""
i'll push you out because i really don't like you
i'm good at sewing, putting it into practice
i'm growling right now, you're in a bit of danger
just do the ""yeon,"" like i said, you have no ""shil""
rise and rise to the sky but get ripped, bucket, i've forgotten you
my voice, my hegemony, i made it from one to ten
i put the whole world on my tongue
i play with big boys, i ain't spittin low sh
on the cd or the tv, you can see me, envy me, it's a pity, gee gee
beat i'mma monster i rap with a prospect, yeah i rap with a mindset i'm a suspect
sucka where yo rhymes at where you lines at? i'm da king, i'm the god so where ma emperors at?
i parachute on my neverland, i'mma peter pan, so this will never end
you know when i ride on my g5 you sit first class and satisfy and i keep giggling
keep gigglin, keep jigglin, bring yo booking mic beat, wanna have a go?
hyungs who are sick with pride and strange beliefs get lost after 8 measures
you old catepillars, i'll give you this beat, give it a try
hey, start talking when you can start rapping
there should be a law restricting you from rapping

because of who? because of j-hope

the next batter will rap on top of this beat

speech and action are like shackles, my crime is assault with my tongue
you're so bad ever since you were born
if you're gonna whine about this beat, just leave
look at the arrogance of the hip-hop con artists
when you were playing underground, bts was playing at ground level
compared to you who sleeps all night, i'm a workaholic, shoppaholic
overspending on my pens that are more in number than your fans, if i go all in and shoot, it's a goal in
goal in, i'm ballin, when i hear your rap, i'm about to throw up
my voice even bewitches your girlfriend
the studio is my playground, my partner is a pen and paper
you think being escorted makes you powerful, i hope you put down your mic
if i'm the sun, you're the moon, because when i rise, you go down
all you hip-hip designer brand bastards, come down from the foamy bubbles
hey you brats, your crappy rap is a burden to others
take a break and wait, just go to hawaii, go home
see how far i go, all the rotten roots will be replaced
everyone, let's play a game, without efforts, you'll just be grieving
you think you can do music? just go look for a part-time job
although your short and thin career will get you nowhere
i hope you survive, keep rotting away, that's your label
your life is like a mudfish, your rap is recycled
you save up and divide up the flow, write it up and use it again
hey beat, know that you're embarrassing, just with 24 measures, you lay down sick
compared to your size, your rap is so thin
like your parents, my heart hurts every time i see you
i'll put a period at the artery of your music career",en,because of who because of jhope because of who because of rap mon again because of who because of suga all of the style and flow is because of

you know bts is back!

with shoes worth a couple hundred, padded jacket worth a couple thousand
with a watch worth a couple hundred you feel good about yourself
education goes over the hill and student identity goes over the hill too
the class system of the 21st century is divided into two
those who have and those who havenat
those who wear the shoes and those who donat
those who have the clothes and those who donat
and those who try hard to get those things
whatas going on? are you falling behind on the trend?
you whined and complained to get it, did i strike a nerve?
in your padded jacket, your greed fills it up
even after seeing your parentsa curved spines, youare so coldhearted
you complain that all your friends have it and that they should buy it for you
(ayo baby) stop being so immature
you wonat freeze just because you donat have that jacket
fill your head with good sense before itas too late

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
youare something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!
what is wrong with you? youare crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

iam saying iall spend my own money that i received

please go take care of yourself
itas about your life, if you were me, i wouldnat say anything
yeah, my jacket is really expensive and not pretty at all
(but i say) i really want it so what do i do?
friends who are poorer than me have it too
(and i say) i have no choice but to buy it if i donat wanna be an outcast
people my age are all like this
yeah i dunno, yes iam loco, is it no-no?
i know they ainat cheap but they got mojos
but i do what i gotta do, i donat break my parentas spines
the true breaker is you, who is old and stuck in your room

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
youare something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong
what is wrong with you? youare crazy baby
that is what will suffocate your heart, dirty clothes

dirty clothes for you, dirty clothes for me
everyone experienced it before
wearing expensive clothes and walking on the street, feeling good about yourself
everyone looks smaller than me like iam gulliver
whatever you wear, i understand but youare too much
youare gonna regret it
you can keep your swag on but how about your parents?
fine, i wonat stop you but make a decision now

that encounter awakens a different me
now iall go up on stage
and surprise everyone by jumping like jordan
ball!
go back a few years
taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air
you used to feel the joy of each jump, feeling like you have everything
letting myself go to the innocent dreams
my childhood days was impatient to be an adult
but each day was filled with joy
so can i be the one, just can i be the one
that i... stop

Hip Hop Lover/Phile ,"people wonder why we love this h-i-p h-o-p, shit
why we got so much guys in this culture, tell me

it was a new world
i didnat think much of writing or poems
but it came to me suddenly like shim chung
i used to be a flightless bird but it opened my eyes
but people keep askina baby
why you love that hiphop shit?
then i tell them, i donat have a reason
itas cause itas hip hop
nothing special, epik high
just like others jay-z, nas
and of course the classic illmatic and doggystyle
in my mind, krs-one
and ready to die, eminem
and the chronic and the next classic 2001
gang starr, black star, eric b
rakim, pete rock and cl smooth
they juss keep poppin
thatas all i listened to
i was like an old lady
i had so much to say that it
wasnat enough with what other people told me
first, i forced it
layer after layer, calling it lyrics
and that was it! uh that was it
when i became me
on the white paper in between my textbooks
i put myself
and i erased it, emptied it
i was free on top of the beat
seven years ago or now
itas the same, this is the most me

iall be down for your rap
iall be down for your rhythm
it still makes my heart pound
it makes me be the real me
yeah i love this

(hip! hop!) has the scent of humans
(hip! hop!) writing down my life
(hip! hop!) is now part of my life
(hip! hop!) yeah this ma (hip! hop!)

yo ma hiphop enrollment?
i felt it with my body as i entered
boogaloo, king tut, old school rhythms
entrusting the beat with rhyme and my tongue
it shows its prominence, itas rap dance time
yeah ma role model
dynamic duo, verbal with epik high
iam still inexperienced as i write my resume
breaking down my namelessness, flying on stage
they helped me get up when i didnat know anything
the artist, ring that rang through my heart
expressing it with their bodies, biggie, 2pac, nas
i found out more about myself
hope hope world
before i made my own world, cole world
ever since he shone on friday nights
i got inspiration and wrote my songs
mac miller, kanye, kendrick
their music hits my ears
the best musicians that affixed
my lifeas borders that went crazy every day
endless diction, all right, my instincts choose
whatever rap it is, whatever dance it is
my response is sensual
now my life melts with hip hop
today, iam wild for the night, my body
feel like a$ap a$ap

iall be down for your rap
iall be down for your rhythm
it still makes my heart pound
it makes me be the real me
yeah i love this

(hip! hop!) has the scent of humans
(hip! hop!) writing down my life
(hip! hop!) is now part of my life
(hip! hop!) yeah this ma (hip! hop!)

hip hop has found me
just like a child looks for his mother
it came into my life naturally
i was just an elementary student back then
i set up my dream then
i want a rapstar, as others
i hated living the same, the prematurity of a little kid
even if people hold me down and warn me
hip hop persists in me
and completely turns me inside out
the young me used to write
my 16 bars on the corner of my textbooks
thanks to that, i threw away my secure life
and went to a studio in namsan-dong, daegu
all night, i sharpened my blunt pen tip
at the end of my efforts
instead of having a language marks for school
i filled up my rhymes
which made my dreams come true
everyone asks me, what is hip hop?
then i confidently answer, my everything
as a result, my life has buried itself into music
if loving this culture is a sin
iall die over a hundred times

iall be down for your rap
iall be down for your rhythm
it still makes my heart pound
it makes me be the real me
yeah i love this

(hip! hop!) has the scent of humans
(hip! hop!) writing down my life
(hip! hop!) is now part of my life

Let Me Know ,"on top of this ending tune
i am standing here alone
now tell me
that itas over, let me know

suddenly, rain wells up in my eyes
you well up, i see you even when i breathe
love blooms like cherry blossoms but burns and becomes ashes
hey girl i know, the conclusion you made by yourself
your hand, your body, your body heat that was hotter than the equator
iam still here, on repeat on top of the disappeared tune
iam turning by myself on top of this music that has ended

on top of this ending tune
i am standing here alone
now tell me
that itas over, let me know

although i already know everything is over
just so no regrets are left behind

my lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
so please tell me something, girl let me know

the promises we made disappeared with the time we spent together
the dominos have fallen with our breakup
like juliet and romeo
did i like you too much?
the heat between me and you wonat cool down
now i look back at the film with you
too early to do anything by thinking of you
you took away my stars at night, my sun at day
only leaving me with the darkness of a single cold cloud
if there are hellos, then thereas bound to be goodbyes? never ever
i donat care about that, i donat want to stick to that
iall turn away, hypnotizing myself

on top of this ending tune
i am standing here alone
now tell me

although youare over me

i just wanna know
i just wanna know
my lingering feelings are trying to withstand the end
so please tell me something, girl let me know

maybe weare all just a bunch of fools
everyone lives with a love that has come to an end
itas not that i still have feelings for you
i know we canat work out
but why does it feel like iam having indigestion?
as if my insides will explode, cries come up my throat, making me throw up
in my imagination, i fight with you, make up with you and understand you
your hand gestures, your eyes, they are faded but not gone
why wonat it go away?
why wonat it go away?
why wonat it go away?

Rain ,"(the thick color of a rainy day in seoul)
the racing cars, the squirming umbrellas all over the place
itas cloudy and the air is clear
(the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle)
with a light gray background, why am i standing here?
i donat know if i have a lot of thoughts or no thoughts at all
i wake up when itas just about to get bright outside
i brush back my hair when my exhausted hands
the memopad with the song i couldnat complete last night
iall finish it today as i shut my eyes and let out a sigh
what excuse can i give? i try to make something up
itas unfinished anyway so iall just make anything up
then i turned my eyes to the window and everything looks gray
gray city, gray buildings, gray roads, gray rain
everything in this world is slow
my younger sibling who woke up keeps talking back
i keep opening and closing the innocent refrigerator
with the unknown empty feeling that washes over me
i think that i should just go outside
without even an umbrella
i can clearly hear the rain hitting the earth
i smile, itas the best background music
like a crazy guy, i start to hum
i wonder what time it is
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still canat fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
itas a rainy night, the rain knocks on my window, it hits my heart
with my sore shoulders, i look at my phone and see a text, ahow are you these days?a
my friendas text gets my emotions going
as i inhale the scent of the wet rain, i stretch and go to the bathroom
then i greet myself, half asleep in the mirror
i have no one to meet but i take a longer shower than usual
rain is still falling outside the house
i have no where to go but i take my umbrella
and walk outside without a plan
as if the rain wants its existence to be known, my shoes get dirty
am i someone who engraved my existence to you like the rain?
if not, am i just someone who came and went like a rain shower?
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still canat fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
i get up and when i feel sore, i look out the window
as if it knows how my body feels, the rain is falling
as i look at the raindrops welling up in the window, i felt it
the tears that were flowing down my heart
with that strange feeling, i look outside and it looks like my situation
the rain that falls like a melody makes everything seem andante
i get ready and leave, opening the umbrella that was as wrinkled as my face
as i walk, the moment i heard the rain
i wondered who this rain was falling for
a sound that hits against the lonely gray cement
come slow down
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still canat fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
even when this rain stops, when the clouds go away
i stand here, just the same
without saying anything, looking at the world
there, a not so beautiful me is looking at myself
in this rain

Cypher Pt. 3: Killer  (Ft. Supreme Boi),"kill 'em, kill 'em!

whatever you do i will kill for
whatever i do i'll be real for
look closely, this is the beast mode you wanted
when men smoke, and women smoke wind, i smoke beat
this a beat smoke
who the man told you crazy?
who the fella told you crazy?
i'm better than ya lazy
rather than those who do hip-hop through the keyboard
i live a hundred times harder
they look at rap easily genre, too many generals
uncertain, ambiguous all of them have some manners
those who can't even continue on one verse
because they try to discuss rap or music
that's why here they all still rap the same way like this
only three or two words, they're all critical patients
mother-father aphasic patient all just con artist
back yourself and look at the mirror
if you want to be a piece, make it an original
just try something suckas the sincerity in this is zero
i got by the name of monster welcome to the monster plaza
this a cypher i'm a rider imma ride it like a biker
oh shit slip it backwards beat
you're a drain and i feel content
the kids whose skills are on strike
do so much protest behind my back
man what you afraid of, i'm confident on top of the beat
you're a beggar, from your pocket to the skills you don't have, you're poor
i don't need givenchy cause i'm a star
i don't need hugo already a boss
i'm not buddha but i'm a butcher i cut away your flesh like a
change your iphone
you donat need your airplane mode
my roaming fees are hundreds of dollars
and you know i can take it more
make money with rocks, sell rocks, you frauds
san paulo to stockholm, places you'll never sit in your entire life i sit

haters i have a lot but no problem, i kill
the shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
bitch i don't care, you can't control my shit
i became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again

this fourth albums focus point cypher
when this track comes out haters will totally turn from the worse
on this scene that's about illegal things
this songs legality will make everyone fall into a trap
hang hang over bang
explode and come out swag
whenever i go, i drive straight
and wherever i go, it's there the losers of hip-hop
they're at a different proportion of levels to be cussing at me
busy by my talking has come, all unnies call me beep beep
someone's cussing at me
tell them to look at their own situation and then come to me
i don't have anything to be jealous of about others
oh on top of the beat beat i wiggle wiggling jingle jingling
i roll, roll around, act like a beagle, then i start to burn up
strength right now right now
ruling over on top of the on top of the ring
a king who will surpass the name of a god
this is just a sample, just a snack
my rap will soon be a korean meal to fill your stomach
that's right, my nation korea
all the rap mansiks' trying to spit out poor english
look at who's on top of you now

haters i have a lot but no problem, i kill
the shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
bitch i don't care, you can't control my shit
i became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again

s-u-g-a a.k.a agust d, my second name
when i walk in the streets, they whisper my name
from daegu to apgujeong my beat that have been laid
the lives of my music that breath and live here and there all over the world
iam a baby shaman who dances on the jakdu called the beat, thatas me
my self that is shown through the tv
did you know that half of it is a kagemusha?
you're all just big talk with your mouth, but that's rapping
the spirit of my heavy king rap that hits towards the lies of the solicit nompaengis
rappers who act arrogant
my flow job that takes them all and toys around with them
if you try to damage me with simple words like that
i only become stronger
the mysterious me is a bulgasari who grows by eating your jealousy and envy
like you all know my voice turns people on
whether it be men or women
my flexible tongue movements will send them to hong kong with my raps
on top of the food chain
i'm always on the highest point of the summit
my idiocy that won't end
even if someone tries to try to fuck me over from the back
while you guys play around
we're going around the world
hyungnims who gained age carelessly
from my standards, you're at the level of a kid too
even if i'm wack or if i'm fake if i'm this or that
i'm the new standard of the music industry
this rap will throw a slap an endless slap at their ears chop chop chop

Blanket Kick/Embarrassed ,"(one, two, three, four)
iam doing so many things, iave become a tree
why am i getting weirder in front of you?
iam not a pre-schooler but why is everything so childish?
look at my eyes, my jokes arenat serious
saying this is so hard, i like you
i was too shy to become your sun so i became a cold moon
but afterwards, i keep making a wave of blankets on top of my ocean bed
i jump around like a crazy guy
winning over my embarrassed feelings with some ufc moves
with a high kick and a jab and a hook
with some pounding, i let it all out in my blanket
oh gimme an iron so i can smooth out my hands and feet
you have already made it into several lines of my lyrics
itas even more than that, but my poor blanket
i just wish you were here
only you only you
again, iam acting weird in front of you
youare so pretty pretty pretty
but why am i like this?
i sleep and kick my blankets around
only you woo woo woo woo woo (you!)
you woo woo woo woo woo (you!)
why did i do that? my head is spinning
i keep kicking my innocent blankets (kick kick)
oh pretty pretty pretty (pretty)
oh pretty pretty pretty (pretty)
to me, itas only you
only you
my eyes follow your eyes, nose, lips
but please donat misunderstand
i canat hold it in when i see you, this is such a pain
i take a big gulp and say, acheers instead of watera
iam not even drunk but i pretend to be drunk and act cute
iam not a pencil but i keep getting dark thoughts toward you
did you notice my dark thoughts?
i try to hide it but i canat, itas just useless efforts
time goes tick tock and when iam in front of your house
i try to set the mood
this time, iall really pretend iam crazy
and give you a deep kiss so i grab your shoulders
but then the phone rings
your dad asks when youare coming back home
oh my god, the mood was so good
before i sleep, i get angry at my blanket again
it was so gooda|
only you only you
again, iam acting weird in front of you
youare so pretty pretty pretty
but why am i like this?
i sleep and kick my blankets around
should i go or not? then i went
should i do it or not? then i did it
making jokes and playing around, getting physical and acting cute
but my arrow keeps missing your target
where is it? is that where your heart is? why did i do that the other day?
itas a sleepless night again today, the blanket on my bed is my sandbag
kick kick kick
only you only you
again, iam acting weird in front of you
youare so pretty pretty pretty
but why am i like this?
i sleep and kick my blankets around
only you woo woo woo woo woo (you!)
you woo woo woo woo woo (you!)

bias, negative comments, double standards, smack talk and disinterest

Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment In Life,"the rim looks farther away today
sighs are building on top of the court
the boy is afraid of reality
but his heart is at peace only when he throws the ball
throwing the ball by himself
what iam shooting at the rim
are my countless thoughts and worries
i pretend to know the world but my body is still not ready
shoot, the court is my playground
with my movements, a small ball bounces next to my feet
the results are as low as the floor
but i just shout out loud to the world that everythingas gonna be alright
but the world gives me fear, then just stop
thoughts fill my head and instead of the ball, i throw my future
because of the otheras standard of success
my worries spread like cancer again, god damn it
along with the thrown ball, laughter starts to spread
my breath rises to my chin, my dreams squirm about
the dribbles get faster, my heart gets happier
this moment feels like itall last forever but the sun is setting
when the night comes again, reality gets destroyed
when i snap out of it, iam just a scared idiot again
i keep getting scared at the looming sense of reality
others are running ahead but why am i still here?
breathe or dream
row the oars along with your heartbeat
if you are trapped in the otheras thin judgements
then the sun will set on your life like a court
what am i doina with my life
this moment wonat ever come again
iam asking myself again, am i happy right now?
the answer is already there, iam happy",en,the rim looks farther away today sighs are building on top of the court the boy is afraid of reality but his heart is at peace only when he throws the ball throwing the ball by himself what iam shooting at the rim are my countless thoughts and worries i pretend to know the world but my body is still not ready shoot the court is my playground with my movements a small ball bounces next to my feet the results are as low as the floor but i just shout out loud to the world that everythingas gonna be alright but the world gives me fear then just stop thoughts fill my head and instead of the ball i throw my future because of the otheras standard of success my worries spread like cancer again god damn it along with the thrown ball laughter starts to spread my breath rises to my chin my dreams squirm about the dribbles get faster my heart gets happier this moment feels like itall last forever but the sun is setting when the night comes again reality gets destroyed when i snap out of it iam just a scared idiot again i keep getting scared at the looming sense of reality others are running ahead but why am i still here breathe or dream row the oars along with your heartbeat if you are trapped in the otheras thin judgements then the sun will set on your life like a court what am i doina with my life this moment wonat ever come again iam asking myself again am i happy right now the answer is already there iam happy,rim looks farther away today sighs building top court boy afraid reality heart peace throws ball throwing ball iam shooting rim countless thoughts worries pretend world body still ready shoot court playground movements small ball bounces next feet results low floor shout loud world everythingas alright world gives fear stop thoughts fill head instead ball throw future otheras standard success worries spread like cancer god damn along thrown ball laughter starts spread breath rises chin dreams squirm dribbles get faster heart gets happier moment feels like itall last forever sun setting night comes reality gets destroyed snap iam scared idiot keep getting scared looming sense reality others running ahead still breathe dream row oars along heartbeat trapped otheras thin judgements sun set life like court doina life moment wonat ever come iam asking happy right answer already iam happy,"{'neg': 0.215, 'neu': 0.568, 'pos': 0.218, 'compound': 0.1531}",0.1531,Neutral

iam going crazy, exhausted without you
i think of you without stopping
i hate it all, i hate every single day
it makes me cry, ring ding dong

Moving On,"ayo suga
i remember how we came here three years ago
when you and i used to fight all the time
the wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
back then i thought this was a big place
but my ambition grew too big
that big house became too small now
when the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
good things were always other peopleas things
we were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
letas not forget those things but put them away
this place smells like us
letas not forget this scent, wherever we are
we cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

letas move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letas move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

three years felt so short but so long
a lot of things happened, there were many memories
i remember now that weare about to leave
traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
as much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
maybe thatas why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
even the dust will be cleared now
thereas more stuff than the beginning, i have more than when i started too
now letas take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
a new start, a new beginning
excited to see how it will become
move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
after youare done, letas get a bowl of black bean noodles, thatas right

letas move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letas move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

ever since i was born
i counted the days for my first move
i remember, why i had to move
the machine in my momas heart and the big scar
in winter of 2010 at daegu
the childish me used to measure the size of the world
the reason why we moved into a business
was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
so moving left many things with me
whether i liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
my life was about paying rent, i know
i lived with my pride put into the down payment
so iam gonna move again
iam gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
when will i stop having to move again?
i hope it comes quickly

letas move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letas move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room

goodbye now

INTRO : Never Mind ,"i only look forward and run
without having time to look around

and i have succeeded to some extent
they say teenage years mess you up
i think of it suddenly
at that time i was young
and had nothing to fear
a few times defeated isnat much
if thereas anything thatas different itas my height
and also being a bit more mature for my age
from the underground workplace in namsandong
my beat has been laid out until apgujeong
the origin of youth
everyone said it, donat go overboard
if you act as if youare a know-it-all and will be making music
you will make your home go broke
from that point onwards, i didnat care
no matter what anyone said
i only lived how i wanted, guided by only my beliefs
in your eyes, how do you think iam doing right now
how do you think i am
i want to ask the several people who prayed for me to screw up
does it seem like my home is going broke, you bastards?

i donat give a shit i donat give a fuck
like i always said hundreds of time every day, anever mind mea
i can have a taste of failure and frustration and bow my head
we are still young and immature, donat even worry about it
moss surely grows on a stone that doesnat roll
if you canat return, go straight through your mistakes and forget them all
never mind
itas not easy but engrave it onto your chest
if you feel like youare going to crash then accelerate more, you idiot
come on

no matter how thorny the road is, run

Whalien 52 ,"yeah, the most lonely creature in the world
eh, do you want to know my story?
iave never told this to anybody
yeah, come on

in the middle of the vast ocean
one whale speaks softly and lonelily
the fact that no matter how much they shout, it wonat reach
makes them so gravely lonely that they quietly shut their mouths
of course i donat care whatas the matter or what iave now become
when loneliness is the only thing that stays by my side
iave become completely alone. it's a lock that fills sadness
someone says, abastard, youave become a celebritya
oh fuck that! so what?! nobody remains by my side and i'm fine on my own
these words that are easily said towards me quickly becomes a wall
even loneliness turns into something you can see

even if my breaths are blocked
because iam confined in that wall
(i) head towards the surface of water above
hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesnat have a response
reaches tomorrow

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
an endless signal will reach someday
everywhere, even to the other side of the earth

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
even the blind whales will be able to see me
today i sing again

the world will never know
how sad i am
my hurt is water and oil that canat mix
so only above the surface of the water do i
breathe, and the interest (towards me) ends
a child in the lonely ocean
i want to make it known too
my value, everyday
i become sick with worry, the sticker always beneath my ear
never enda| why is there no end and always hell?
as time goes by, itas a neverland in a cold abyss!
but i always think, now
even if i sleep a shrimpas sleep, my dreams are like that of a whaleas
the upcoming big praise will make me dance everyday
like me, ye iam swimmina

i go towards my future
that blue beach and
believe in my hertz
hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesnat have a response
reaches tomorrow

mom said the sea is blue
she said to let out your voice as far as you can
but what to i do? itas so dark here and there are only different whales speaking entirely different words!
i just canat hold it, ma! i want to say i love you
alone, i look back at this music sheet thatas like a rotating song
this ocean is too deep
still, iam lucky
(no one besides me knows of these tears.)

Skit: One Night in a Strange City ,"he's always late, should i say something?
  ah, say something
  say something in behalf of bangtan
  right, right
  i'll say something for the leader-hyung
  hey, hey! stop coming late!
  right, right
  (knock on the door, bell rings) hey! jung hoseok! jung hoseok!
  he's here
  go open the door
  say something
  seriously we need to say something
  say something what? what
  he's here, he's here
  jimin-ie is going to say something
  hyung, i thought about it but don't you think that you've gone over the line a little?
  what is? what? what?
  don't you think you're coming a little too late these days?
  wow, what are you saying?
  i personally think that is completely understandable considering he's the leader
  lol
  am i not human?
  why are you being like this to me?
  who do you think you are?
  ugh, i'm so tired
  namjoon-hyung is leader-hyung, he gets privileges
  exactly, the leader suffers so much
  leader-hyung suffering, (mumble mumble)
  i'm sorry, i think i'm the wrong
  i'm sorry we're (v & jimin) are same age friend as well, ugh
  yeah, things are hard for me these days, ah my shoulders hurt
  we've finished now
  is your shoulder right?
  ah, i don't know
  wow, i almost feel asleep while washing up
  i don't know why but i feel like that is possible
  yeah, you did that the other time
  hey, but kids
  just like sitting on the ground or something
  when i saw before v looked like he was going to die maybe that's why he wasn't singing?
  but i surprisingly get a lot of motivation support from v-hyung
  quit it
  lol
  ah, seriously stop being like that
  yeah you looked like you were having a rough time
  ah i said stop it
  you must have had such a hard time
  ah! seriously!
  not doing the dance properly as well
   yeah
  but seriously today ''i need u'' was so great
  dope! dope! it was awesome!
  oh yeah dope! dope was the best
  okay, yeah, they're all great but, don't you think ""danger"" was a killer?
  danger
  okay, but with ''i need u'', i can't even imagine how would it have been like if the ''i need u girl'' bit wasn't in it
everyone sings along to it, ''i need u girl'' you know that bit
  suga-hyung wasn't even like rapping at the beginning
  yeah, yeah, suga wasn't
  suga-hyung wasn't rapping at all
  he was just like holding the microphone
  suga-hyung was just doing stuff like this
  hey hey hey, i'll just say one thing
  he's really just half-assing it
  please just piss off
  lol
  if you don't even want to do that
  you just wanted to say that didn't you?
  that means that your voice didn't come out in ''i need u''
  it came out well, that's for sure
  i felt good, though, to be honest when suga-hyung didn't rap but everyone sang along anyway
  okay but imagine this
  there were so many people there as well and it just felt so good
  we just opened our eyes but we're practicing for ''no more dream'' in the training room, how would you feel?
  no, no, i'm not going back
  no them, i'm just to go down a different path
  yep okay, you do down another road
  that's it, you are doing ''no more dream'' right now only eating chicken breast
  no no no no, i can't
  you are with that cold argilla chicken breast
  seriously the manager-hyung. what about the scene where you secretly tried to have salt with the chicken breast and got
caught?
  oh no, no no no no
  my perm hair
  like seriously, this is just like all a dream and ''i need u''.  ''i need u '' is all a dream
  but seriously
  but sometimes it does seem like a dream
  but it's not just that
  don't say things like that!
  back in the day i used to eat world cone but now i'm doing world tours
  ah fainting, ugh okay
  what is that
  your sense of humor had significantly dropped
  these things get cut out immediately
  with one song
  okay but seriously, this could all be a dream, like to be honest there were lots of artists that did well in korea
  that's true
  i always think you should do well with one song first then go further but i'm a little bit anxious because it's not like our title song has come out yet or anything
  that's true
  ah this kid has a talent in bringing down the mood
  suddenly... it's almost like the titanic
  yep
  right before it sinks
  it's been overthrown
  ah, yoongi-hyung just happens to say something like this, really bursts the bubble
  i know right
  ""the title hasn't even come out yet''
  i know right, ''the title songs hasn't even... ''
  no wait! okay, so the title just has to come out well, right?
  yeah
  yeah then just like make it well, huh? release it and boom it will be a hit again. so easy amirite?

Autumn Leaves/Dead Leaves,"fall like those dry leaves

those fallen leaves that look so insecure

if i touch your hand, even if itas all at once
it seems like itall all become crumbs
i only looked
with the autumn wind
your words and expressions that become cold at some point
i can see that our relationship is fading
an empty relationship like the autumn sky
an ambiguous difference compared to before
today of all days, the much quieter night
one leaf left clinging to a branch
itas shattering, i see the end
dead leaves becoming dried
the silence inside your aloof heart

like all the things i thought would last forever are leaving
you are my fifth season
even if i try to see you, i canat look
youare still green to me
even if the heart doesnat move, it moves by itself
lingering feelings hung out piece by piece like laundry
only crimson memories fall
from above me
even if my branch doesnat shake
they constantly fall
right, my love must fall
in order to rise
even when youare near, my two eyes
are far away, itas happening

i try to look back on these lost seasons
i try to turn back

burn them brightly, whoosh
it was all beautiful, right, our path
but theyave all faded

the wind blows and everything grows apart all day

Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment In Life,"the rim looks farther away today
sighs are building on top of the court
the boy is afraid of reality
but his heart is at peace only when he throws the ball
throwing the ball by himself
what iam shooting at the rim
are my countless thoughts and worries
i pretend to know the world but my body is still not ready
shoot, the court is my playground
with my movements, a small ball bounces next to my feet
the results are as low as the floor
but i just shout out loud to the world that everythingas gonna be alright
but the world gives me fear, then just stop
thoughts fill my head and instead of the ball, i throw my future
because of the otheras standard of success
my worries spread like cancer again, god damn it
along with the thrown ball, laughter starts to spread
my breath rises to my chin, my dreams squirm about
the dribbles get faster, my heart gets happier
this moment feels like itall last forever but the sun is setting
when the night comes again, reality gets destroyed
when i snap out of it, iam just a scared idiot again
i keep getting scared at the looming sense of reality
others are running ahead but why am i still here?
breathe or dream
row the oars along with your heartbeat
if you are trapped in the otheras thin judgements
then the sun will set on your life like a court
what am i doina with my life
this moment wonat ever come again
iam asking myself again, am i happy right now?
the answer is already there, iam happy",en,the rim looks farther away today sighs are building on top of the court the boy is afraid of reality but his heart is at peace only when he throws the ball throwing the ball by himself what iam shooting at the rim are my countless thoughts and worries i pretend to know the world but my body is still not ready shoot the court is my playground with my movements a small ball bounces next to my feet the results are as low as the floor but i just shout out loud to the world that everythingas gonna be alright but the world gives me fear then just stop thoughts fill my head and instead of the ball i throw my future because of the otheras standard of success my worries spread like cancer again god damn it along with the thrown ball laughter starts to spread my breath rises to my chin my dreams squirm about the dribbles get faster my heart gets happier this moment feels like itall last forever but the sun is setting when the night comes again reality gets destroyed when i snap out of it iam just a scared idiot again i keep getting scared at the looming sense of reality others are running ahead but why am i still here breathe or dream row the oars along with your heartbeat if you are trapped in the otheras thin judgements then the sun will set on your life like a court what am i doina with my life this moment wonat ever come again iam asking myself again am i happy right now the answer is already there iam happy,rim looks farther away today sighs building top court boy afraid reality heart peace throws ball throwing ball iam shooting rim countless thoughts worries pretend world body still ready shoot court playground movements small ball bounces next feet results low floor shout loud world everythingas alright world gives fear stop thoughts fill head instead ball throw future otheras standard success worries spread like cancer god damn along thrown ball laughter starts spread breath rises chin dreams squirm dribbles get faster heart gets happier moment feels like itall last forever sun setting night comes reality gets destroyed snap iam scared idiot keep getting scared looming sense reality others running ahead still breathe dream row oars along heartbeat trapped otheras thin judgements sun set life like court doina life moment wonat ever come iam asking happy right answer already iam happy,"{'neg': 0.215, 'neu': 0.568, 'pos': 0.218, 'compound': 0.1531}",0.1531,Neutral

Hold Me Tight,"i empty my drink but it gets filled with loneliness
i shouldave just given in, why did i argue all the time?
even the trash bag thrown away on the street makes a lonely sound in the wind
all i did was color you in my white, blank paper
but then i realized, it already became a finished picture
you and i are like cell phones, when weare apart you know weall be broken
only your scent completes me

open my closed heart, drench my heart
so i can feel you, hold me

your arms, your warmth, your heart
i want to see it all, i beg you
this moment, even the warm flower scented wind
even the sky without a single cloud
everything feels cold and iam even scared of the clear sky
if youare not here, iam just a corpse, so how can i breathe?
it hurts, iam always cry cry cry
iam going crazy, exhausted without you
i think of you without stopping
i hate it all, i hate every single day
it makes me cry, ring ding dong
if thereas a chance, iall catch you
iam running, itas starting, count down
iam ready to be cut by your rose-like embrace, as i hold you again

i only looked
with the autumn wind
your words and expressions that become cold at some point
i can see that our relationship is fading
an empty relationship like the autumn sky
an ambiguous difference compared to before
today of all days, the much quieter night
one leaf left clinging to a branch

dead leaves becoming dried
the silence inside your aloof heart

you are my fifth season
even if i try to see you, i canat look
youare still green to me
even if the heart doesnat move, it moves by itself
lingering feelings hung out piece by piece like laundry
only crimson memories fall
from above me
even if my branch doesnat shake
they constantly fall
right, my love must fall
in order to rise
even when youare near, my two eyes
are far away, itas happening

Epilogue: Young Forever ,"the curtain falls and iam out of breath
i get mixed feelings as i breathe out
did i make any mistakes today
how did the audience seem
iam happy with who iave become
that i can make someone scream with joy
still excited from the performance

i stand on the empty stage while holding onto an aftertaste that will not linger for long
while standing on this empty stage, i become afraid of this unpleasant emptiness
within my suffocating feelings
on top of my lifeas line
without a reason, i forcibly act that i am fine
this isnat the first time, i better get used to it
i try to hide it, but i canat
when the heat of the show cools down
i leave the empty seats behind

trying to comfort myself
i tell myself the world canat be perfect
i start to let myself go
the thundering applause, i canat own it forever
i tell myself, so shameless
raise your voice higher
even if the attention isnat forever, iall keep singing
as todayas me, i want eternity
forever, i want to be young

forever we are young

under the flower petals raining down
i run, so lost in this maze

forever we are young

even when i fall and hurt myself
i endlessly run toward my dream

Moving On,"ayo suga
i remember how we came here three years ago
when you and i used to fight all the time
the wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
back then i thought this was a big place
but my ambition grew too big
that big house became too small now
when the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
good things were always other peopleas things
we were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
letas not forget those things but put them away
this place smells like us
letas not forget this scent, wherever we are
we cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

letas move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letas move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

three years felt so short but so long
a lot of things happened, there were many memories
i remember now that weare about to leave
traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
as much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
maybe thatas why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
even the dust will be cleared now
thereas more stuff than the beginning, i have more than when i started too
now letas take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
a new start, a new beginning
excited to see how it will become
move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
after youare done, letas get a bowl of black bean noodles, thatas right

letas move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letas move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

ever since i was born
i counted the days for my first move
i remember, why i had to move
the machine in my momas heart and the big scar
in winter of 2010 at daegu
the childish me used to measure the size of the world
the reason why we moved into a business
was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
so moving left many things with me
whether i liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
my life was about paying rent, i know
i lived with my pride put into the down payment
so iam gonna move again
iam gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
when will i stop having to move again?
i hope it comes quickly

letas move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
letas move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

letas move

staying, moving on, staying, moving on

Whalien 52 ,"yeah, the most lonely creature in the world
eh, do you want to know my story?
iave never told this to anybody
yeah, come on

in the middle of the vast ocean
one whale speaks softly and lonelily
the fact that no matter how much they shout, it wonat reach
makes them so gravely lonely that they quietly shut their mouths
of course i donat care whatas the matter or what iave now become
when loneliness is the only thing that stays by my side
iave become completely alone. it's a lock that fills sadness
someone says, abastard, youave become a celebritya
oh fuck that! so what?! nobody remains by my side and i'm fine on my own
these words that are easily said towards me quickly becomes a wall
even loneliness turns into something you can see

even if my breaths are blocked
because iam confined in that wall
(i) head towards the surface of water above
hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesnat have a response
reaches tomorrow

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
an endless signal will reach someday
everywhere, even to the other side of the earth

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
even the blind whales will be able to see me
today i sing again

the world will never know
how sad i am
my hurt is water and oil that canat mix
so only above the surface of the water do i
breathe, and the interest (towards me) ends
a child in the lonely ocean
i want to make it known too
my value, everyday
i become sick with worry, the sticker always beneath my ear
never enda| why is there no end and always hell?
as time goes by, itas a neverland in a cold abyss!
but i always think, now
even if i sleep a shrimpas sleep, my dreams are like that of a whaleas
the upcoming big praise will make me dance everyday
like me, ye iam swimmina

i go towards my future
that blue beach and
believe in my hertz
hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesnat have a response
reaches tomorrow

mom said the sea is blue
she said to let out your voice as far as you can
but what to i do? itas so dark here and there are only different whales speaking entirely different words!
i just canat hold it, ma! i want to say i love you
alone, i look back at this music sheet thatas like a rotating song
this ocean is too deep
still, iam lucky
(no one besides me knows of these tears.)
iam a whalien

First Love ,"the corner of my memory
a brown piano settled on one side
in the corner of my childhood house
a brown piano settled on one side

i remember that moment
way taller than my height
the brown piano that guided me
i looked up to you, i yearned for you
when i touched you with my small finger

i feel so nice mom i feel so nice
i played the piano wherever my hands took me
i didnat know your significance back then
back then i was content with just looking at you

i remember back during my elementary school days
when my height
became taller than yours
i neglected you when i once yearned for you so
on top of the white jade-like keyboard
dust is piling on
your image that has been neglected
even then i didnat know
your significance
no matter where i am
you always defended that spot
but i didnat know that would be the last
you say donat leave like this

donat worry even if i leave
youall do well on your own
i remember when i first met you
before i knew it you grew up
though we are putting an end to our relationship
donat ever feel sorry to me
i will get to meet you again no matter what form
greet me happily then

i remember back then when i met you that
i had completely forgotten, when i was around 14
the awkwardness was only for a moment, i touched you again
even though i was gone for a long time
without repulsion
you accepted me
without you i am nothing
after the dawn, two of us
we welcomed the morning together
donat let go of my hand forever
i wonat let go of you again either

i remember back then
we burned up the last of my teenas
yes the days when we couldnat see an inch in front of us
we laughed, we cried
those days with you, those moments are now in memories
i said, grasping my crushed shoulder
i really canat do any more
every time i wanted to give up
by my side you said
bastard you can really do it
yeah, yeah i remember back then
when i was fed up and lost
back then when i fell into a pit of despair
even when i pushed you away
even when i resented meeting you
you were firmly by my side
you didnat have to say anything
so donat ever let go of my hand
i wonat let you go ever again either
my birth and the end of my life
you will be there to watch over it all

Reflection ,"i know
every lifeas a movie
we got different stars and stories
we got different nights and mornings
our scenarios ainat just boring
i find this movie very amusing
everyday, i want to shoot it well
i want to caress myself
i want to caress myself
but you know, sometimes
i really really hate myself
to be honest, quite often
i really hate myself
when i really hate myself, i go to dduksum
i just stand there with the familiar darkness
with the people that are smiling
and beer, which makes me smile
coming to me softly
fear, which holds my hand
itas okay because everyone is in twos or threes
itas good that i have a friend, too


the world is just another name for despair
my height is just another diameter for the earth
i am all of my joy and anxiety
it repeats everyday, the love and hate directed to me
hey you, whoas looking over the han river
if we bump into each other while passing, would it be fate?
or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life
maybe we bumped into each other countless times
in the darkness
people look happier than the day
everyone else knows where theyare supposed to be
but only i walk without purpose
but still, blending in with them is more comfortable
dduksum, which has swallowed up the night
hands me an entirely different world
i want to be free
i want to be free from freedom
because right now iam happy but iam unhappy
iam looking at myself
at dduksum

despite my dadas opposition, every time i attacked

but a road of dreams while gripping debt

the problem of money eventually my mother
go away

tie me up so i can't escape
hold me tight and shake me up
so that i can't come to my senses

First Love ,"the corner of my memory
a brown piano settled on one side
in the corner of my childhood house
a brown piano settled on one side

i remember that moment
way taller than my height
the brown piano that guided me
i looked up to you, i yearned for you
when i touched you with my small finger

i feel so nice mom i feel so nice
i played the piano wherever my hands took me
i didnat know your significance back then
back then i was content with just looking at you

i remember back during my elementary school days
when my height
became taller than yours
i neglected you when i once yearned for you so
on top of the white jade-like keyboard
dust is piling on
your image that has been neglected
even then i didnat know
your significance
no matter where i am
you always defended that spot
but i didnat know that would be the last
you say donat leave like this

donat worry even if i leave
youall do well on your own
i remember when i first met you
before i knew it you grew up
though we are putting an end to our relationship
donat ever feel sorry to me
i will get to meet you again no matter what form
greet me happily then

i remember back then when i met you that
i had completely forgotten, when i was around 14
the awkwardness was only for a moment, i touched you again
even though i was gone for a long time
without repulsion
you accepted me
without you i am nothing
after the dawn, two of us
we welcomed the morning together
donat let go of my hand forever
i wonat let go of you again either

i remember back then
we burned up the last of my teenas
yes the days when we couldnat see an inch in front of us
we laughed, we cried
those days with you, those moments are now in memories
i said, grasping my crushed shoulder
i really canat do any more
every time i wanted to give up
by my side you said
bastard you can really do it
yeah, yeah i remember back then
when i was fed up and lost
back then when i fell into a pit of despair
even when i pushed you away
even when i resented meeting you
you were firmly by my side
you didnat have to say anything
so donat ever let go of my hand
i wonat let you go ever again either
my birth and the end of my life
you will be there to watch over it all

i really really hate myself
to be honest, quite often
i really hate myself
when i really hate myself, i go to dduksum
i just stand there with the familiar darkness
with the people that are smiling
and beer, which makes me smile
coming to me softly
fear, which holds my hand
itas okay because everyone is in twos or threes
itas good that i have a friend, too


the world is just another name for despair
my height is just another diameter for the earth
i am all of my joy and anxiety
it repeats everyday, the love and hate directed to me
hey you, whoas looking over the han river
if we bump into each other while passing, would it be fate?
or maybe we bumped into each other in our past life
maybe we bumped into each other countless times
in the darkness
people look happier than the day
everyone else knows where theyare supposed to be
but only i walk without purpose
but still, blending in with them is more comfortable
dduksum, which has swallowed up the night
hands me an entirely different world
i want to be free
i want to be free from freedom
because right now iam happy but iam unhappy
iam looking at myself
at dduksum

i want to believe in my path

lost my way
found my way
lost my way
found my way

i once saw an ant going somewhere
there is no way to find the path at once
constantly crashing and crawling forward
to find something to eat
roaming for days

you know
there is a reason for all this frustration
i believe that weare on the right path
if we ever find it
we will return home at once
just like an ant

this is too hard, is this path right for me
i am so confused
donat you leave me alone
i still want to believe even though itas unbelievable
to lose your path
is the way to find that path

lost my way
constantly pushing without rest
within the harsh rainstorms
lost my way
within a complicated world without an exit
lost my way
lost my way
i wander
i want to believe in my path

so long
goodbye to my hope with no promise
so long
even if iam slow i will walk with my own feet
because i know this path is mine to take
even if i go back, i will reach this path eventually
i never i will never
i will never lose my dream

lost my way
constantly pushing without rest
within the harsh rainstorms
lost my way
within a complicated world without an exit
lost my way

Spring Day,"miss you
saying this makes me miss you even more
miss you
even though iam looking at your photo
timeas so cruel, i hate us
seeing each other for once is now so hard between us

itas all winter here, even in august
my heart is running on the time
alone on the snowpiercer
wanna get to the other side of the earth, holding your hand
wanna put an end to this winter
how much longing should we see snowing down
to have the days of spring, friend

like the tiny dust, tiny dust floating in the air
will i get to you a little faster
if i was the snow in the air

snowflakes fall down
and get farther away little by little
i miss you (i miss you)
i miss you (i miss you)
how long do i have to wait
and how many sleepless nights do i have to spend
to see you (to see you)
to meet you (to meet you)

passing by the edge of the cold winter
until the days of spring
until the days of flower blossoms
please stay, please stay there a little longer

is it you who changed (is it you who changed)
or is it me (or is it me)
i hate this moment, this time flowing by
we are changed you know
just like everyone you know

yes i hate you, you left me
but i never stopped thinking about you, not even a day
honestly i miss you, but iall erase you
'cause it hurts less than to blame you

RM: We talked about if we would even be able to debut for a long time.
Suga: We always talk about that
J-Hope: We were nervous
Jimin: Namjoon-hyung always said things like that
Jin: Thati? 1/2s right
Jimin: We talked about it at Jamsil bridge and at the cafi? 1/2 with this hyung. He always called me up and always talked to me.
Jin: He called the members and talked to the members one by one often
RM: Cafi? 1/2 office. (Laughter)
Suga: Honestly it was scary. Every day was scary.
V: Honestly, when me and Namjoon-hyung took Japanese classes together
RM: Thati? 1/2s right

J-Hope: Oh, Jungkook and I always fell asleep in English class! (Laughter)
Jungkook: We both fell asleep in the same way (Laughter)
Jin: J-Hope and I only played in Chinese class (Laughter)
J-Hope: That was a really long time ago

RM: To be honest, we are the only ones that received an award at the show as a K-Pop group
J-Hope: True
V: True

RM: Ii? 1/2m not saying we should boast, but to be honest it is a huge success. Thati? 1/2s what I think. But because of that, I keep wondering - To what point, how far we need to go up. Like we go really far up. For example, the video in front of us, woni? 1/2t it be replayed forever? Like in 10 years, we'll go on reality shows and theyi? 1/2ll play that video and ask how we felt over and over again. After experiencing that, it makes me nervous honestly. It makes me wonder how far we might fall down.
J-Hope: Ow... Yeah
Suga: Me too, me too. I relate so much because the hardest thing for me is that going up is going up. We worked hard to come up to where we are.
V: I doni? 1/2t like that
Suga: But compared to that, woni? 1/2t falling down happen so quickly? I worry about that a lot.
RM: Hmm, thati? 1/2s what Ii? 1/2m saying

Like even now, our album title is i? 1/2Love Yourselfi? 1/2 too. We doni? 1/2t make meaningless songs, but doing this seems like wei? 1/2re acting too, as wei? 1/2re living our life.

Suga: This is, this is difficult. I mean it isni? 1/2t fake for sure
Jimin: Right
Suga: If you think about it, wei? 1/2re just people that are presented after being wrapped up nicely
Jimin: But of course at the same time, it's not like we're trying to deceive anyone and lie... it's not that... we're just always trying to show them our good sides, so...",en,  logan paul and lindsey

what is your name
do you have a place to go
oh could you tell me?
i saw you hiding in this garden

all of your warmth is real
the blue flower your hand was picking
i want to hold it but

show you me
give you me
i canat show you a ruined part of myself
once again i put a mask on and go to see you
but i still want you

bloomed in a garden of loneliness
a flower that resembles you
i wanted to give it to you
after i take off this foolish mask

but i know
i can't do that forever
i have to hide
because i'm a monster

i am afraid
i am shattered
iam so afraid
that you will leave me again in the end
once again i put on a mask and go to see you

the only thing i can do
in the garden
in this world
is to bloom a pretty flower that resembles you
and to breathe as the me that you know
but i still want you
i still want you

maybe back then
a little
just this much
if i had the courage to stand before you
would everything be different now

without a name to myself, i still revolve around you

Outro: Tear ,"goodbyes are, for me, a tear
without even knowing, it blooms around my eyes
the words that i could not bring myself to say flow down
and lingering regret crawls over my face
to me, you were once my dear
but now you're merely a bitter beer
my heart that's stained with belated self-loathing
becomes empty even with the passing breeze
at the end of my play where breakup was a lie
the price that i had to pay came to me
if someone said they would turn back the time for me
would i have been able to be a bit more honest?
the bare face that only i know
the ugly and pathetic old friends within me
would you still be able to love me again like before
with that smile with which you used look at me
stop saying things like forever, forever
after all, the end originally exists
if there's a start, i don't wanna listen to that
words that are too correct or too much consolation.. i don't wanna listen to that
i was just so scared
because it seemed like perhaps i had never loved you at all
although it was late, that you were true
that only you loved me
more

you're my tear
you're my, youare my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
what more can i say?
you're my tear

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last
although we used to talk about forever
now we break each other without mercy
although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
that dream has finally become a dream
my heart is torn, please burn it instead
so that pain and regret, none of that would be left

you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my fear
you're my, you're my fear
what more can i say?
you're my...

goodbyes are t.e.a.r
because things like tears are a luxury
there's no such thing as beautiful goodbyes
so just begin now
woo take it easy, slowly carve out my heart
that's right, thatas right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
so that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
that's right, right there, what are you hesitating for
this is the ending you were wishing for
so go on and kill me without hesitating
woo yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
so not even the ashes remain

this is the real you and this is the real me
now we've seen the end and not even resentment is left
i've woken up from the sweet dream and i close my eyes
this is the real you and this is the real me

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last
although we used to talk about forever
now we break each other without mercy
although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
that dream has finally become a dream
my heart is torn, please burn it instead
so that pain and regret, none of that would be left

you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my fear
you're my, you're my fear
what more can i say?
you're my...

what should i say?
we know
the answer is fixed
but replying is always hard

why are you spilling it?
why are you tearing it up?
it's useless, to me
goodbye to me is only those moments (flashback)
the moment you say words from your mouth
the moment our focus becomes irregular
at the moment where everything is dangerous
our end that two letters handed to us
that i won't cry, that i won't tear it up
i can't say those kinds of words. in the future i, too
breakup, incurable disease
you're my beginning and my end, that is all
my meeting and my farewell
you were everything, step forward fear
it will be repeated, caused by you

she seemed flustered as she stared at the diary she once believed she lost. within every turned page were the movies she liked, the places she wanted to go, the flowers she preferred, and the future she hoped for. i had done this for her. aiam sorry,a never came easy for me. the diary acted as a starting and stopping spot for us.
i wanted to make her happy. i wanted to make her laugh. i wanted to be a good person. i thought that following the words from the diary would help me do so. but thatas not how it worked. the more i tried to be someone else the more frightened i became. wouldnat my real self be discovered? wouldnat she be disappointed and leave me? desperately, i hid and turned away from myself. but just like how a person canat end a sentence without it being complete, the me who i lost couldnat improve and instead wandered around the same places.
i know now that the me that is incapable and makes mistakes and fails is still a part of myself. no matter how terrible things become, only by being true to myself can i continue to move forward. i stood up and she didnat stop me.
i left onto the street and took my hat off. as i swept my hair back, all the hours i spent trying to mold myself into someone else slipped through my fingers. i lifted my head and looked at my reflection in the window. staring back at me were pale lips, a frail face, thin shoulders. i looked wretched. i laughed. my reflection laughed too.

a lone flowerpot rested on the storage roomas window. i didnat know where it came from. which of my dongsaeng brought it? i took out my phone. the classroom was always dark with shadows since there wasnat any electricity, but i could still distinguish green leaves from the pale light coming from the windows. the photo i took on my phone didnat come out good, and it wasnat because i simply took it with a phone. i pondered this often - how a photo never captures what eyes can.
i noticed an aha written below the flowerpot when i approached. when i lifted it up i read ahoseokas flowerpot.a i laughed. hoseok was the only dongsaeng whoad bring a flowerpot here. i placed it back on the windowsill so only the aha is visible again. i then looked around. i didnat notice this before, but the windowsill was covered with scattered writing. the walls and ceiling were covered in it too. apass or die,a the names of unrequited love, dates, and countless names that had become worn and illegible.
this classroom hadnat always been a storage room. students used to filter it every day. itad be filled when school began and emptied during vacations. were there students like us? would they receive punishments for being late and missing class? were there mercilessly violent teachers and never ending exams and coursework? were there teachers whoad tell principals about their students and their friends?
i wondered whether my fatheras name lied among the words. the school was my fatheras alma mater. he was someone who believed attending the same schools maintained a familyas dignity. i read over the names and found my fatheras. it was in the middle of the left wall surrounded by other names. a quote was written underneath it, aeverything started here.a

it was april 11th again when my eyes opened. sunlight shined through the open curtain. i was overwhelmed with vertigo when i stood up. i had to close my eyes. when i did this, my surroundings morphed into a red afterimage, and i saw taehyung. he was standing alone on top of the observation platform at the sea. that happened on may 22nd. it was the past and the future. it was something thatad happened already and something that still had the chance to happen again. it was then that i thought everything had finally been fixed.
i watched taehyung climb to the top of the platform as the sun began to set. the sky was still blue, but it was slowly blooming into red. i saw taehyung climbing when i lifted my head. he reached the top after a few moments and looked down at us. then he jumped. he leapt as if he had the wings of a bird, and for a few seconds it seemed as if he froze in the air. something overcame me the way a mirror breaks, the way cold air blows in from an open window.
when my eyes opened again it was today, april 11th.

what was the reason that that particular melody became stuck in my head only after i lost the person iad practice it with? i glanced at the piano across the room as i reclined on the couch. when i was expelled i threw away the piano key that belonged to my mother - the only thing i'd salvaged from the ruins of my burned house. the piano key half burned itself. i threw it out of my apartmentas window. i thought doing so would end it. i repeated to myself, like i had all those years ago, that iad never lay my hands on a piano again.
early the next day, i hurried down the stairs unable to wait for the elevator. i thought iad fallen asleep abruptly, but the sun had risen already. the things i did the night before suddenly flooded my thoughts. the flowerbed outside the window was vacant. when i asked the security guard he told me that the garbage truck had already came, and thatas how i lost my motheras piano key.
i continued to give up on music after that countless times. i wonat do it. i wonat come back. music is nothing. but even when i ran away, i knew. i knew that iad return to music. the same why iad stumbled down that staircase, music was the kind of thing iad never be able to let go of. internally, i was just as free as i was a person who was suffering. i was confused, but i was also lucid. fear and confidence, hope and despair - i lived between those contrasting emotions.
suddenly, i was overcome with the desire to play the piano. i wanted to recognize the me who had pretended to be strong despite the reality that i was a fearful coward. i wanted to pour the curses and make fractures and inflict wounds and hit and destroy and hold and cry. but i didnat want to run away. i wanted to finish the melody from the piano that frequented my mind every day. for once, it seemed like i could.

i kept walking with the acknowledgement that jungkook was following me. containers continued to appear when i reached the train tracks. it was the fourth container from the back. hoseok mentioned having plans to meet namjoon and taehyung. he told me to join them. i said i would, but i didnat really plan to attend. i hated being attached to other people, and hoseok knew that. he probably didnat expect iad stay true to my word.
when i pulled the door open, hoseok stared at me shocked. when he saw jungkook behind me an exaggerated expression of mixed emotion drew across his face. i pushed past both of them and strolled to the container. ahow long has it been?a i could hear hoseok trying to pull jungkook, who was shy, in.
namjoon and taehyung entered. a side of taehyungas shirt was ripped. when questioned about it, namjoon pretended to hit taehyung with his knuckles. athis kidas late because he got caught by some cops doing graffiti and i had to go pick him up.a taehyung made a melodramatic apologetic face and explained that his shirt had been ripped in the process of running away.
i sat in the corner and watched them. namjoon gave taehyung a new shirt to change into, and hoseok pulled out hamburgers and beverages. in the midst of everything, jungkook stood awkwardly. he stood as if he hadnat any idea what to do.  in retrospect, itas exactly how he acted in high school. hoseok would noisily move around while jungkook hovered around him unsure of what to do.
how long had it been since we met like this? i couldnat remember. what happened to seokjin hyung and jimin? an uncharacteristic thought crossed my mind. this was the place iad visited for the first time while my heart was lost somewhere else.

the sheet was immediately engulfed in flames. the pile of objects lost their identities among the intense heat. i couldn't smell the rotting mold nor feel the overbearing humidity nor see the dark light. the only thing left was pain - the pain of the flames, the pain of my fingers blistering. it was only among the fire that my fatheras emotionless expression and the sound of music relented.
i was very different from my father. he didnat understand me and i didnat understand him. could i have changed his mind if i tried? probably not. all i could do for him was run and hide and defy. it occasionally occurred to me that it wasnat my father that i was escaping. but if it wasnat him, what was it? fear settled in for a moment. what was i running from? what ends did i have to go to to be free? it all felt impossible.
it felt like i could hear someone calling, but i didnat look away from the dancing flames. i couldnat breathe. i donat know if it was the smoke or the pain. i didnat have the power to move anymore. despite this, i knew it was jungkookas voice that was calling. he mustave been upset and angry. maybe head feel bad for me. i just wanted to disappear. i wanted the smoke and heat, just everything, to end. jungkook shouted something again, but i couldnat hear it. my gaze fell. when i looked up again i saw the sight of a dirty room in a dirtier world. during what i thought would be my last moments, i saw red flames, endless smoke, and jungkookas panicked face.

i lifted my head from scanning the magazine advertisements. a different face had been occupying the window seat of the library across from me for the past few days. the heavy book, large bag, and paper cup were the same, but it wasnat her. i looked back down at the magazine. i was reading the same page over and over again for an hour. my eyes werenat processing the words at all. why was i still here? i couldnat fabricate an answer. among people who were absorbed in their own worlds, i was carelessly reading the same page of a magazine. i felt impatient, as if something was supposed to start, but i knew nothing would happen.
i brought the magazine back and strolled between bookshelves. they were taller than i was, filled to the brim with books. an open window breeze carried the libraryas scent in the air. i reminisced my highschool years. the books i read in the company of my friends in that storage room had the same scent. had the present me grown from the old me at all? i couldnat bring myself to be positive. it couldave been because everything seemed to be frozen back then. i moved to a different bookshelf and picked an old book i studied from high school. i had to start over. i had to give everything up one at a time.

i knew something was going on with taehyung for a long time. although he pretended that nothing was wrong, his momentary anxieties gave it away. the fact that he didnat know how to handle it made it all the more obvious to me. he was in and out of the police station. he had wounds all over his body. he had nightmares.
i never pressed on the issue because i was waiting for taehyung to bring it up himself. the reason i never confronted him was also because i doubted my own to right to hear about it. i wanted to be a hyung, an adult. but in the end it all comes to the simple fact that i couldnat help my friends when they were struggling. they praised me for being all grown up, but i wasnat really an adult. faced with problems, i could only hesitate and ignore the reality before me.
yoongi hyung died - taehyung had that nightmare again today. i had to shake him from his sleep. he sat in silence for a long time staring into space. he didnat wipe his tears and he mumbled incoherent things. he mumbled about yoongi dying and jungkook getting in an accident and me being caught up in a fight. he said that he dreamed of those types of things everyday - that the traumas were so clear that they seemed real. ahyung, donat go anywhere.a

i finished pumping gas. i begun returning to the shop. something brushed against my face and fell. stepping back, a crumbled bill settled at my feet. out of reflex, i reached down. the random people in the car laughed, and i stopped reaching down. seokjin hyung watched me from a distance. i couldnat raise my head. what are you supposed to do when you make eye contact with people who drive expensive cars and ridicule others? you confront them. if you believe theyare doing something unjust then you have to confront them. itas not a matter of pride or bravery or equality. itas something that you just have to do.
but i was a part-time worker at a gas station. if a customer threw trash i had to clean it up. if they cussed me out i had to listen. if they threw a bill at my feet i had to pick it up. my body shook with humiliation. i dug my fingernails into my palm.
at that moment, someoneas hand reached down and picked up the bill. the car filled with people left as if the fun was over. i couldnat look up even after they were gone. i didnat have the courage to look seokjin hyung in the eyes. it wasn't like he didnat know about my cowardliness, my poverty, my situation, but i still didnat want him to witness it. hyung stood at the end of my gaze. he didnat move. he didnat approach. he didnat speak.

jimin and she stood in the middle of the practice studio. the starting pose seemed endless. when the music flowed from the speaker, they begun the choreography i practiced with her not that long ago. i watched from my place on the floor.
when i first discovered that my ankle momentary prevented me from dancing, itad been hard to swallow. it was stifling to simply watch otheras dance. but overtime, as i taught and helped jimin improve, i realized that not being able to dance wasnat that big of a deal. i could continue to be happy other ways.
i couldnat let even the smallest of mistake go overlooked when i helped jimin. when he made a movement smaller or more subdued, iad stop him and examine each movement individually. but when i returned to my place on the floor, almost like an audience for jimin, i realized that jiminas dancing was bigger that just the step to step movements. i viewed what i originally recognized as mistakes differently. the trivial mistakes and imperfections contributed  to something greater, something unique. it was different than my own dancing, but jimin had his own timing and his own expression. his dancing was bight and heartwarming on its own.
when the music ended, jiminas dance did too. his face glowed with excitement and happiness. she stood next to him. shead be going overseas soon. we locked eyes. she didnat look like my mother at all because i couldnat remember my motheras face. so why did i see my mother in her? my heart began to ache, and the pain in my ankle intensified.

i liked being around people. when i was still at the orphanage i worked at a fast food chain and was exposed to a lot of people. iad always laugh and be cheerful. i liked that job. with my experience of being exposed to more bad than good, it was evident that i had few reasons to laugh and be cheerful. perhaps thatas why i enjoyed the job so much. it gave me the opportunity to laugh and smile and be happy. what does it matter if it was usually forced? overtime i could trick myself into believing that it was all real. my mood became better when i let myself laugh and by treating people kindly i became a kinder person. there were hard days, like always, and sometimes taking a step forward would be too overwhelming. but even so, it was easier back then to withstand the hard days because i had friends. things arenat the same now.
sometimes i remembered my friends when i looked at the store of customers. seokjin hyung, who transferred in, namjoon, who disappeared one day, yoongi, who wouldnat answer calls anymore, taehyung, whose whereabouts we werenat sure of, and jimin, who never returned after he went to the emergency room. iad seen jungkook in his school uniform through the window a few times, but he never frequented the store anymore. perhaps those times had passed.
i heard the sound of a customer entering. with a cheerful smile, i greeted them.

i opened the emergency exit door and rushed down the staircase. my heart felt like it was going to explode. i swore i glimpsed the clear face of my mother in the hospital hallway. when i looked back, people from the opened elevator doors distorted my vision. i pushed through the people and followed where iad seen my mother leaving through the emergency exit. without rest and with an anxious heart, i ran down the stairs two at a time.
amom!a my mother ceased her walking. she turned around. i ran down another flight. her face became visible. it was then that i lost my balance and my center of gravity fell forward. i closed my eyes, but a personas hand reached out and held onto my arm. when i looked back at my savior, jimin stared at me with a shocked expression. before i could thank him, i turned my head.
there was a woman with a surprised face. a young boy stood next to her with wide, unblinking eyes. the woman wasnat my mother. i remained at the top of the staircase staring at her blankly.
i didnat remember how i got out of that situation. i didnat ask how jimin had managed to catch my fall either. my mind couldnat focus on such trivial details. the woman wasnat my mother, and somewhere deep down i knew that from the start. itas been more than 10 years since she left me alone in that theme park. shead be older now. if i met her, i wouldnat recognize her by now. i could barely even remember how she looked all those years ago.
when i glanced behind me, jimin was following me quietly. back in highschool, jimin told me that he had stayed in the hospital after being in the emergency room. i thought about how he looked at me, unsure of how to respond to the inquiry of whether he wanted to leave the hospital. was jimin trapped the same way i was, incapable of both holding on and letting go of old memories? i took a step toward him.
ajimin-ah. letas get out of here.a

i was stuck in the practice studio again. it was late and the train stopped running. to be honest, i had waited for it to stop so i could practice alone and obsess over my imperfections. i was restless. i was scared. but it was something i wanted to do, and so i stayed in that room overnight.
overtime, my fear in my heart began to evaporate. only the fun air of dancing persisted. for the longest time, i believed that the weak, small, powerfless me i imagined was real. when i danced i could only think of my own weight or the length of my body or my speed or my strength. however, the me who danced wasnat small nor weak. my stuttering movements became more fluid and i improved. i grew the way fingernails do. slowly. i realized that i was actually an expressive person. i felt this way when i danced, like i was saying everything i couldnat. when i started to dance i, for the first time, started to like myself.

hoseok hyung lived in a rooftop apartment at the end of a narrow alley. it was very high. when i visited the one room apartment head brag about how it was the highest room in the city. he bragged that he could see everything, every place, from his rooftop room. from the window we could see the trains and the train tracks and the containers. namjoon hyung lived in one of those. if i moved my gaze down a little i could see the school we all used to attend.
after locating the school, i drew my gaze to the opposite side of the city. a line of apartments rested at the bottom of the mountain. there was my - no - my parentas house. they were looking for me. when i ran away from the hospital without a word they were contacted. i didnat have the confidence to face them. i couldnat go home yet. that didnat mean i wanted to return to the hospital, but i had nowhere to go and no money. hyung had told me to follow him, and he lead me here - hyungas house.
i looked back to the apartment buildings. i had to return eventually. i had to tell my parents i wasnat going back to the hospital. i inhaled sharply and then slowly exhaled. it felt like the mere thought could trigger another seizure. i didnat trust myself anywhere other than at the hospital. i could be rushed there again. i was so afraid. i couldnat stand it.

hoseok hyung stood next to me when i opened my eyes. an all too familiar ceiling looked down at me with a familiar darkness. i tried to sit up, but he put his finger up to his lips. everyone was sleeping. the room was quiet. hyung offered me a new shirt, and jerked his head toward the exit of the hospital.
awe all came together.a  he said that namjoon hyung was keeping guard while yoongi hyung was buying time talking with the nurses. jungkook and taehyung would meet us at the elevator. hyung reached out a hand when he saw my confused expression. i was still in a daze.
iad dreamed of the day iad leave the hospital sometimes. i wanted to leave and see my friends so i could spend time with them and laugh and talk the way we did before, but now i didnat know. was it actually a good idea to leave? my parents hid me here and buried my existence. people whispered that i had a mental illness. i didnat know if hoseok hyung viewed me the same way. maybe he thought i was strange. maybe i made him uncomfortable.
acome on. weare running out of time.a the clockas second hand sound seemed unconventionally fast because of hyungas words. the sound of footsteps, like an auditory hallucination, came closer to the hospital room. hyung and i looked toward the door and then at each other. he never let his hand leave me.

when i turned around, i discovered small letters written below the axa that spelled out short sentences. one said ait isnat my fault.a it was her. i hadnat seen her myself and i didnat know her handwriting, but i knew. it seemed like a last goodbye, saying that it wasnat my fault she left, saying that this didnat happen because i was a bad person, saying that i shouldnat blame or torment myself, saying that i should be brave.
when i came to my senses i was back at my house. i could hear noonaas scream from behind the door. i flung it open and a familiar scene was laid out. i moved to block noona from my father and i grabbed him. i looked him in the eyes and at first he seemed surprised. but then he swung. it knocked me out for a second. this wasnat the first time that sort of thing happened. noonaas crying grew louder. my chin ached and the smell of rust stained my mouth. but i didnat stop. i grabbed my father by his waist and he angrily yelled. he beat my shoulders and back relentlessly. i only held on tighter.
it wasnat that i didnat feel the pain. it wasnat that i wasnat scared. it was the understanding that if i let go, this same daily cycle of pain and suffering would repeat. i wanted things to change.
no. iam not like my father. iam going to protect our family. something he couldnat do.

ahyung, is that all? you arenat hiding anything else from us?a our surroundings became quiet simultaneously. everyoneas eyes were on me. i looked at seokjin hyung. he looked back at me. his eyes were full of exhaustion and pity. somebody grabbed my arm and stopped me before i could press the issue again. i didnat have to look to know it was namjoon hyung.
awhat does it have to do with you? you arenat my real brother.a i could feel namjoonas stare. i shook off his hand without lifting my head. i knew that i was angry at him for no reason. i repeated the words i heard hyung use on the phone - that i was angry, that i was upset. his words werenat incorrect. i was a year younger than him. i wasnat his brother. it was true that i should take care of myself, but i was still upset. i was angrier than i could put into words. i hoped head understand.
ataehyung-ah iam sorry. letas stop talking about this.a it was seokjin hyung who said this. it was seokjin hyung who called my name. it was seokjin hyung who apologized. namjoon hyung didnat do anything. awhat do you mean stop? since itas come up, why donat we talk about everything. you have something else youare hiding.a
aletas talk outside.a namjoon hyung replied holding onto my arm again. he dragged me out before i could shake him off. alet me go. what right do you have to stop me? what do you know, hyung? you donat know anything. you just think heas this great guy, right?a he let go of my arm after that. i stumbled at the release. no, it wasnat just him letting me go that made me stumble. when he released my arm, it felt as if everything that had sustained me for so long crumbled. perhaps i hoped head never let go, that head get angry and drag me out the way he did. perhaps i hoped head scold me like a real brother, like someone close and precious.
but hyung let go of my arm, and i could only laugh. awhatas so special about being together? what are we to each other? weare all alone in the end.a that was the moment seokjin hyung hit me.

the gas station worker spat on the ground when he left, and i sprawled my body on the ground again. iad been caught spraying graffiti on the wall of the gas station, and the owner hit me while asking what i thought i was doing drawing on someoneas wall. i rolled on the ground. getting beaten was something i was used to.
i started graffiti a long time ago when i found a discarded spray can someone left behind. i think it was yellow. i sprayed it around and stared at the paint. it was a bright yellow against the grey wall. for a while, i mindlessly painted like that, and i only stopped when i ran out of paint. i threw it away and stepped back to examine my work. i felt out of breath at the sight.
i didnat know what it meant. i didnat know what the designs and colors stood for or what iad done or why i did it. but i did it, and so i concluded that it was an expression of my feelings stained on the wall. iad spewed my heart out, and at first i thought the drawing was ugly. for a moment, i wanted to erase it from the wall. however, instead of erasing it i caked on other colors and other shapes and other designs. i sat against it when i was done. it didnat matter whether i liked it or not. it didnat matter whether it was beautiful or not. it was me.
i coughed when i rose to my feet. when i hunched over and spat out blood, i saw someoneas hand reach down to pick up the spray can. it was namjoon hyung. i chuckled. i thought he was some sort of ghost. he reached out his hand, and i simply looked back up at him. hyung took my hand and helped me stand up properly. his hand was warm.

when i looked back, the hospital was a faraway place. i couldnat see the bench i left those wildflowers nor the window i looked out with her anymore. she was a space that let me breathe in the stuffy atmosphere of the hospital. wead sit on that bench and talk about everything until the sun would set. i talked about playing in the hideout and vacations i took to the beach and walking to the train station. she told me about the corners of the hospital and which window you could watch the river from and the which staircase secretly led to the roof. there wasnat anything she didnat know about that hospital.
her room was empty because she was discharged. or did she move to a different hospital? i asked the nurses, but they said it was confidential. a corner of my soul felt empty. when i turned around and started walking i could see the school. it seemed that everything i ever told her about myself had something to do with the hyungs. every story i told incorporated them in some way. for the lonelier part of me, the hyungs had become my friends, family, and teachers. my story was intertwined with theirs, and i only existed within them.
at some point it occured to me there may come a time after my time spent with them. one day i may go looking only to discover that theyad be gone. or maybe something else could happen. i didnat know.
i thought about that night, when the moon ascended in the sky, the world turned upside down, the headlamps inverted on themselves, the car passed me and then disappeared, the sound of the engine. it was familiar for some reason. i didnat want to jump to conclusions, but i still kept thinking about that moment.

ahyungs. what do you dream about?a the hyungs looked back at me in response to my question. ai have to write a paper about future hopes.a i elaborated. seokjin hyung opened his mouth and said, ai donat think i have a dream. if i have something i hope for, itas just to the extent ofa| wanting to become a good person?a he cut himself off, seeming embarrassed. then yoongi hyung, who was at the piano, spoke in an airy voice. aitas okay to not have a dream. i donat have one. iam just going to become whatever.a everyone burst out at his words. they fit him well.
aiam going to become a superhero and save the world from bad guys.a taehyung said this while standing on his chair to pose. he reached his arms toward the sky. hoseok hyung scolded him telling him to get down before he got hurt. hoseok hyung then added, ai want to find my mom and live happily. being happy is my dream.a hyung smiled as he spoke. adoes that mean youare unhappy now?a jimin asked. hoseok hyung replied, awhen i was in preschool i wanted to be president, but i didnat have anything i wanted to be after that.a
only namjoon hyung was left after that. after feeling everyoneas eyes on him, he shrugged. ai want to say something nice, but i donat really have a dream either. i just wish my part-time job paid more.a i nodded and stared down at the paper in front of me. the paper was divided into spaces for students and spaces for parents. what did i want to become? i couldnat think of anything to write.

i walked down the rooftop railing of an abandoned building. when i lifted my leg, my foot was shadowed by the darkness bubbling below. the night of the city was spread out underneath my feet. neon signs, honking horns, and dust was scattered around in the dark. for a moment i felt dizzy from vertigo. i stretched my arms out to balance myself. then i thought about it. it would only take one wrong step. itad only take one step to end everything. i leaned toward the darkness and it spread from my foot and up my leg. my breathing stopped when i leaned further. my mind was void of any thoughts. nothing. no one. i didnat want to leave anything behind, but i couldnat remember anything. this was the end.
it was then that my phone began to ring. clarity washed over me as if iad awoken from a dream. my subdued senses returned, and i pulled out my phone. it was yoongi hyung.",en,seokjin 30 august  year

true to myself can i continue to move forward i stood up and she didnat stop me i left onto the street and took my hat off as i swept my hair back all the hours i spent trying to mold myself into

high school hoseok would noisily move around while jungkook hovered around him unsure of what to do how long had it been since we met like this i couldnat remember what happened to seokjin hyung and jimin an uncharacteristic thought crossed my mind this was the place iad visited for the first time while my heart was lost somewhere else yoongi 2 may year 22 the sheet was immediately engulfed in flames the pile of objects lost their identities among the intense heat i couldnt smell the rotting mold nor feel the overbearing humidity nor see the dark light the only thing left was pain  the pain of the flames the pain of my fingers blistering it was only among the fire that my fatheras emotionless expression and the sound of music relented i was very different from my father he didnat understand me and i didnat understand him could i have changed his mind if i tried probably not all i could do for him was run and hide and defy it occasionally occurred to me that it wasnat my father that i was escaping but if it wasnat him what was it fear settled in for a moment what was i running from what ends did i have to go to to be free it all felt impossible it felt like i could hear someone calling but i didnat look away from the dancing flames i couldnat breathe i donat know if it was the smoke or the pain i didnat have the power to move anymore despite this i knew it was jungkookas voice that was calling he mustave been upset and angry maybe head feel bad for me i just wanted to disappear i wanted the smoke and heat just everything to end jungkook shouted something again but i couldnat hear it my gaze fell when i looked up again i saw the sight of a dirty room in a dirtier world during what i thought would be my last moments i saw red flames endless smoke and jungkookas panicked face namjoon 20 july year 22 i lifted my head from scanning the magazine advertisements a different face had been occupying the window seat of the library across from me for the past few days the heavy book large bag and paper cup were the same but it wasnat her i looked back down at the magazine i was reading the same page over and over again for an hour my eyes werenat processing the words at all why was i still here i couldnat fabricate an answer among people who were absorbed in their own worlds i was carelessly reading the same page of a magazine i felt impatient as if something was supposed to start but i knew nothing would happen i brought the magazine back and strolled between bookshelves they were taller than i was filled to the brim with books an open window breeze carried the libraryas scent in the air i reminisced my highschool years the books i read in the company of my friends in that storage room had the same scent had the present me grown from the old me at all i couldnat bring myself to be positive it couldave been because everything seemed to be frozen back then i moved to a different bookshelf and picked an old book i studied from high school i had to start over i had to give everything up one at a time namjoon 28 april year 22 i knew something was going on with taehyung for a long time although he pretended that nothing was wrong his momentary anxieties gave it away the fact that he didnat know how to handle it made it all the more obvious to me he was in and out of the police station he had wounds all over his body he had nightmares i never pressed on the issue because i was waiting for taehyung to bring it up himself the reason i never confronted him was also because i doubted my own to right to hear about it i wanted to be a hyung an adult but in the end it all comes to the simple fact that i couldnat help my friends when they were struggling they praised me for being all grown up but i wasnat really an adult faced with problems i could only hesitate and ignore the reality before me yoongi hyung died  taehyung had that nightmare again today i had to shake him from his sleep he sat in silence for a long time staring into space he didnat wipe his tears and he mumbled incoherent things he mumbled about yoongi dying and jungkook getting in an accident and me being caught up in a fight he said that he dreamed of those types of things everyday  that the traumas were so clear that they seemed real ahyung donat go anywherea namjoon 11 april year 22 i finished pumping gas i begun returning to the shop something brushed against my face and fell stepping back a crumbled bill settled at my feet out of reflex i reached down the random people in the car laughed and i stopped reaching down seokjin hyung watched me from a distance i couldnat raise my head what are you supposed to do when you make eye contact with people who drive expensive cars and ridicule others you confront them if you believe theyare doing something unjust then you have to confront them itas not a matter of pride or bravery or equality itas something that you just have to do but i was a parttime worker at a gas station if a customer threw trash i had to clean it up if they cussed me out i had to listen if they threw a bill at my feet i had to pick it up my body shook with humiliation i dug my fingernails into my palm at that moment someoneas hand reached down and picked up the bill the car filled with people left as if the fun was over i couldnat look up even after they were gone i didnat have the courage to look seokjin hyung in the eyes it wasnt like he didnat know about my cowardliness my poverty my situation but i still didnat want him to witness it hyung stood at the end of my gaze he didnat move he didnat approach he didnat speak hoseok 13 august year 22 jimin and she stood in the middle of the practice studio the starting pose seemed endless when the music flowed from the speaker they begun the choreography i practiced with her not that long ago i watched from my place on the floor when i first discovered that my ankle momentary prevented me from dancing itad been hard to swallow it was stifling to simply watch otheras dance but overtime as i taught and helped jimin improve i realized that not being able to dance wasnat that big of a deal i could continue to be happy other ways i couldnat let even the smallest of mistake go overlooked when i helped jimin when he made a movement smaller or more subdued iad stop him and examine each movement individually but when i returned to my place on the floor almost like an audience for jimin i realized that jiminas dancing was bigger that just the step to step movements i viewed what i originally recognized as mistakes differently the trivial mistakes and imperfections contributed  to something greater something unique it was different than my own dancing but jimin had his own timing and his own expression his dancing was bight and heartwarming on its own when the music ended jiminas dance did too his face glowed with excitement and happiness she stood next to him shead be going overseas soon we locked eyes she didnat look like my mother at all because i couldnat remember my motheras face so why did i see my mother in her my heart began to ache and the pain in my ankle intensified hoseok 2 march year 22 i liked being around people when i was still at the orphanage i worked at a fast food chain and was exposed to a lot of people iad always laugh and be cheerful i liked that job with my experience of being exposed to more bad than good it was evident that i had few reasons to laugh and be cheerful perhaps thatas why i enjoyed the job so much it gave me the opportunity to laugh and smile and be happy what does it matter if it was usually forced overtime i could trick myself into believing that it was all real my mood became better when i let myself laugh and by treating people kindly i became a kinder person there were hard days like always and sometimes taking a step forward would be too overwhelming but even so it was easier back then to withstand the hard days because i had friends things arenat the same now sometimes i remembered my friends when i looked at the store of customers seokjin hyung who transferred in namjoon who disappeared one day yoongi who wouldnat answer calls anymore taehyung whose whereabouts we werenat sure of and jimin who never returned after he went to the emergency room iad seen jungkook in his school uniform through the window a few times but he never frequented the store anymore perhaps those times had passed i heard the sound of a customer entering with a cheerful smile i greeted them hoseok 12 may year 22 i opened the emergency exit door and rushed down the staircase my heart felt like it was going to explode i swore i glimpsed the clear face of my mother in the hospital hallway when i looked back people from the opened elevator doors distorted my vision i pushed through the people and followed where iad seen my mother leaving through the emergency exit without rest and with an anxious heart i ran down the stairs two at a time amoma my mother ceased her walking she turned around i ran down another flight her face became visible it was then that i lost my balance and my center of gravity fell forward i closed my eyes but a personas hand reached out and held onto my arm when i looked back at my savior jimin stared at me with a shocked expression before i could thank him i turned my head there was a woman with a surprised face a young boy stood next to her with wide unblinking eyes the woman wasnat my mother i remained at the top of the staircase staring at her blankly i didnat remember how i got out of that situation i didnat ask how jimin had managed to catch my fall either my mind couldnat focus on such trivial details the woman wasnat my mother and somewhere deep down i knew that from the start itas been more than 10 years since she left me alone in that theme park shead be older now if i met her i wouldnat recognize her by now i could barely even remember how she looked all those years ago when i glanced behind me jimin was following me quietly back in highschool jimin told me that he had stayed in the hospital after being in the emergency room i thought about how he looked at me unsure of how to respond to the inquiry of whether he wanted to leave the hospital was jimin trapped the same way i was incapable of both holding on and letting go of old memories i took a step toward him ajiminah letas get out of herea jimin 28 july year 22 i was stuck in the practice studio again it was late and the train stopped running to be honest i had waited for it to stop so i could practice alone and obsess over my imperfections i was restless i was scared but it was something i wanted to do and so i stayed in that room overnight overtime my fear in my heart began to evaporate only the fun air of dancing persisted for the longest time i believed that the weak small powerfless me i imagined was real when i danced i could only think of my own weight or the length of my body or my speed or my strength however the me who danced wasnat small nor weak my stuttering movements became more fluid and i improved i grew the way fingernails do slowly i realized that i was actually an expressive person i felt this way when i danced like i was saying everything i couldnat when i started to dance i for the first time started to like myself jimin 16 may year 22 hoseok hyung lived in a rooftop apartment at the end of a narrow alley it was very high when i visited the one room apartment head brag about how it was the highest room in the city he bragged that he could see everything every place from his rooftop room from the window we could see the trains and the train tracks and the containers namjoon hyung lived in one of those if i moved my gaze down a little i could see the school we all used to attend after locating the school i drew my gaze to the opposite side of the city a line of apartments rested at the bottom of the mountain there was my  no  my parentas house they were looking for me when i ran away from the hospital without a word they were contacted i didnat have the confidence to face them i couldnat go home yet that didnat mean i wanted to return to the hospital but i had nowhere to go and no money hyung had told me to follow him and he lead me here  hyungas house i looked back to the apartment buildings i had to return eventually i had to tell my parents i wasnat going back to the hospital i inhaled sharply and then slowly exhaled it felt like the mere thought could trigger another seizure i didnat trust myself anywhere other than at the hospital i could be rushed there again i was so afraid i couldnat stand it jimin 15 may year 22 hoseok hyung stood next to me when i opened my eyes an all too familiar ceiling looked down at me with a familiar darkness i tried to sit up but he put his finger up to his lips everyone was sleeping the room was quiet hyung offered me a new shirt and jerked his head toward the exit of the hospital awe all came togethera  he said that namjoon hyung was keeping guard while yoongi hyung was buying time talking with the nurses jungkook and taehyung would meet us at the elevator hyung reached out a hand when he saw my confused expression i was still in a daze iad dreamed of the day iad leave the hospital sometimes i wanted to leave and see my friends so i could spend time with them and laugh and talk the way we did before but now i didnat know was it actually a good idea to leave my parents hid me here and buried my existence people whispered that i had a mental illness i didnat know if hoseok hyung viewed me the same way maybe he thought i was strange maybe i made him uncomfortable acome on weare running out of timea the clockas second hand sound seemed unconventionally fast because of hyungas words the sound of footsteps like an auditory hallucination came closer to the hospital room hyung and i looked toward the door and then at each other he never let his hand leave me taehyung 11 august year 22 when i turned around i discovered small letters written below the axa that spelled out short sentences one said ait isnat my faulta it was her i hadnat seen her myself and i didnat know her handwriting but i knew it seemed like a last goodbye saying that it wasnat my fault she left saying that this didnat happen because i was a bad person saying that i shouldnat blame or torment myself saying that i should be brave when i came to my senses i was back at my house i could hear noonaas scream from behind the door i flung it open and a familiar scene was laid out i moved to block noona from my father and i grabbed him i looked him in the eyes and at first he seemed surprised but then he swung it knocked me out for a second this wasnat the first time that sort of thing happened noonaas crying grew louder my chin ached and the smell of rust stained my mouth but i didnat stop i grabbed my father by his waist and he angrily yelled he beat my shoulders and back relentlessly i only held on tighter it wasnat that i didnat feel the pain it wasnat that i wasnat scared it was the understanding that if i let go this same daily cycle of pain and suffering would repeat i wanted things to change no iam not like my father iam going to protect our family something he couldnat do taehyung 1 may year 22 ahyung is that all you arenat hiding anything else from usa our surroundings became quiet simultaneously everyoneas eyes were on me i looked at seokjin hyung he looked back at me his eyes were full of exhaustion and pity somebody grabbed my arm and stopped me before i could press the issue again i didnat have to look to know it was namjoon hyung awhat does it have to do with you you arenat my real brothera i could feel namjoonas stare i shook off his hand without lifting my head i knew that i was angry at him for no reason i repeated the words i heard hyung use on the phone  that i was angry that i was upset his words werenat incorrect i was a year younger than him i wasnat his brother it was true that i should take care of myself but i was still upset i was angrier than i could put into words i hoped head understand ataehyungah iam sorry letas stop talking about thisa it was seokjin hyung who said this it was seokjin hyung who called my name it was seokjin hyung who apologized namjoon hyung didnat do anything awhat do you mean stop since itas come up why donat we talk about everything you have something else youare hidinga aletas talk outsidea namjoon hyung replied holding onto my arm again he dragged me out before i could shake him off alet me go what right do you have to stop me what do you know hyung you donat know anything you just think heas this great guy righta he let go of my arm after that i stumbled at the release no it wasnat just him letting me go that made me stumble when he released my arm it felt as if everything that had sustained me for so long crumbled perhaps i hoped head never let go that head get angry and drag me out the way he did perhaps i hoped head scold me like a real brother like someone close and precious but hyung let go of my arm and i could only laugh awhatas so special about being together what are we to each other weare all alone in the enda that was the moment seokjin hyung hit me taehyung 29 march year 22 the gas station worker spat on the ground when he left and i sprawled my body on the ground again iad been caught spraying graffiti on the wall of the gas station and the owner hit me while asking what i thought i was doing drawing on someoneas wall i rolled on the ground getting beaten was something i was used to i started graffiti a long time ago when i found a discarded spray can someone left behind i think it was yellow i sprayed it around and stared at the paint it was a bright yellow against the grey wall for a while i mindlessly painted like that and i only stopped when i ran out of paint i threw it away and stepped back to examine my work i felt out of breath at the sight i didnat know what it meant i didnat know what the designs and colors stood for or what iad done or why i did it but i did it and so i concluded that it was an expression of my feelings stained on the wall iad spewed my heart out and at first i thought the drawing was ugly for a moment i wanted to erase it from the wall however instead of erasing it i caked on other colors and other shapes and other designs i sat against it when i was done it didnat matter whether i liked it or not it didnat matter whether it was beautiful or not it was me i coughed when i rose to my feet when i hunched over and spat out blood i saw someoneas hand reach down to pick up the spray can it was namjoon hyung i chuckled i thought he was some sort of ghost he reached out his hand and i simply looked back up at him hyung took my hand and helped me stand up properly his hand was warm jungkook 26 july year 22 when i looked back the hospital was a faraway place i couldnat see the bench i left those wildflowers nor the window i looked out with her anymore she was a space that let me breathe in the stuffy atmosphere of the hospital wead sit on that bench and talk about everything until the sun would set i talked about playing in the hideout and vacations i took to the beach and walking to the train station she told me about the corners of the hospital and which window you could watch the river from and the which staircase secretly led to the roof there wasnat anything she didnat know about that hospital her room was empty because she was discharged or did she move to a different hospital i asked the nurses but they said it was confidential a corner of my soul felt empty when i turned around and started walking i could see the school it seemed that everything i ever told her about myself had something to do with the hyungs every story i told incorporated them in some way for the lonelier part of me the hyungs had become my friends family and teachers my story was intertwined with theirs and i only existed within them at some point it occured to me there may come a time after my time spent with them one day i may go looking only to discover that theyad be gone or maybe something else could happen i didnat know i thought about that night when the moon ascended in the sky the world turned upside down the headlamps inverted on themselves the car passed me and then disappeared the sound of the engine it was familiar for some reason i didnat want to jump to conclusions but i still kept thinking about that moment jungkook 28 may year 19 ahyungs what do you dream abouta the hyungs looked back at me in response to my question ai have to write a paper about future hopesa i elaborated seokjin hyung opened his mouth and said ai donat think i have a dream if i have something i hope for itas just to the extent ofa wanting to become a good persona he cut himself off seeming embarrassed then yoongi hyung who was at the piano spoke in an airy voice aitas okay to not have a dream i donat have one iam just going to become whatevera everyone burst out at his words they fit him well aiam going to become a superhero and save the world from bad guysa taehyung

live happily being happy is my dreama hyung smiled as he spoke adoes that mean youare unhappy nowa jimin asked hoseok hyung replied awhen i was in preschool i wanted to be president but i didnat have anything i wanted to be after thata only namjoon hyung was left after that after feeling everyoneas eyes on him he shrugged ai want to say something nice but i donat really have a dream either i just wish my parttime job paid morea i nodded and stared down at the paper in front of me the paper was divided into spaces for students and spaces for parents what did i want to become i couldnat think of anything to write jungkook 11 april year 22 i walked down the rooftop railing of an abandoned building when i lifted my leg my foot was shadowed by the darkness bubbling below the night of the city was spread out underneath my feet neon signs honking horns and dust was scattered around in the dark for a moment i felt dizzy from vertigo i stretched my arms out to balance myself then i thought about it it would only take one wrong step itad only take one step to end everything i leaned toward the darkness and it spread from my foot and up my leg my breathing stopped when i leaned further my mind was void of any thoughts nothing no one i didnat want to leave anything behind but i couldnat remember anything this was the end it was then that my phone began to ring clarity washed over me as

Trivia: Seesaw ,"it was a good start
the ups and downs, themselves
before i knew it, we grew tired
with meaningless emotional drains
repeated seesaw game
now, i'm so sick of this
repeated seesaw game
we're getting sick and tired of each other
were the petty arguments the start?
the moment i became heavier than you
because there have never been parallels in the first place
maybe it was my greed trying to match myself with you
if it was love, and if this is what love means
is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
we're tired of each other, yet seem to be holding the same cards
well, then
alright, a repeating seesaw game
it's about time we put an end to it
all right, this boring seesaw game
somebody has to get off of it
there's no turning back
let's not measure who will get off first
letas not drag things out
let's follow our hearts
let's put an end to this
this repeated seesaw game
let's end this now
people can be so crafty
we know someone gets hurt if the other is gone
but because we don't want to be the villains
in the midst of a series of vague responsibilities
we became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel
although this wasn't the kind of parallel that i wanted
at first, we showed off who was heavier
we bragged and smiled at each other
now we're trying measure who's heavier
a competition between us
that became a flame, igniting quarrels
itall only end if someone gets off right here
acting like weare comforting each other
with words mixed with thorns
canat keep doing this, we need to make a decision
if we didnat have feelings for each other
if we didnat think of each other
would we have dragged it out like this?
now if you donat have any more feelings
this seesaw is dangerous
stop thinking about me

Tear,"goodbyes are, for me, a tear
without even knowing, it blooms around my eyes
the words that i could not bring myself to say flow down
and lingering regret crawls over my face
to me, you were once my dear
but now you're merely a bitter beer
my heart that's stained with belated self-loathing
becomes empty even with the passing breeze
at the end of my play where breakup was a lie
the price that i had to pay came to me
if someone said they would turn back the time for me
would i have been able to be a bit more honest?
the bare face that only i know
the ugly and pathetic old friends within me
would you still be able to love me again like before
with that smile with which you used look at me
stop saying things like forever, forever
after all, the end originally exists
if there's a start, i don't wanna listen to that
words that are too correct or too much consolation.. i don't wanna listen to that
i was just so scared
because it seemed like perhaps i had never loved you at all
although it was late, that you were true
that only you loved me
more

you're my tear
you're my, youare my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
you're my tear
you're my, you're my tear
what more can i say?
you're my tear

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last
although we used to talk about forever
now we break each other without mercy
although we thought that we dreamed the same dream
that dream has finally become a dream
my heart is torn, please burn it instead
so that pain and regret, none of that would be left

you're my...

goodbyes are t.e.a.r
because things like tears are a luxury
there's no such thing as beautiful goodbyes
so just begin now
woo take it easy, slowly carve out my heart
that's right, thatas right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
so that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
that's right, right there, what are you hesitating for
this is the ending you were wishing for
so go on and kill me without hesitating
woo yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
so not even the ashes remain

this is the real you and this is the real me
now we've seen the end and not even resentment is left
i've woken up from the sweet dream and i close my eyes
this is the real you and this is the real me

we walked towards the same place
but this place becomes our last

you're my...

what should i say?
we know
the answer is fixed
but replying is always hard

why are you spilling it?
why are you tearing it up?
it's useless, to me
goodbye to me is only those moments (flashback)
the moment you say words from your mouth
the moment our focus becomes irregular
at the moment where everything is dangerous
our end that two letters handed to us
that i won't cry, that i won't tear it up
i can't say those kinds of words. in the future i, too
breakup, incurable disease
you're my beginning and my end, that is all
my meeting and my farewell

not so perfect but so beautiful

why did i hide my true self?

Answer: Love Myself ,"iam opening my eyes in the darkness

doesnat require anyone elseas permission
iam looking for myself again

Intro: Persona ,"who am i? the question i had my whole life
the question which i probably wonat find an answer to my whole life
if i were answerable with a few more words
then god wouldnat have created all these various beauties
how you feel? howare you feeling right now?
actually iam real good but a little uncomfortable
i'm still not so sure if i'm a dog or a pig or what else
but then other people come out and put the pearl necklace on me
ptui!
i laugh more than i did before
i dreamt of becoming a superhero
now it feels like i really became one
but as it goes on thereas so much blabbering
one says, ""run"" another says, ""stop""
this one says, ""look at the forest"" that one says, ""look at the wild flower""
my shadow, i wrote and called it hesitation
it has never hesitated after becoming that
it keeps appearing under the stage or the light
keeps glaring at me scorchingly like a heat wave (oh shit)
hey, have you already forgotten why you even started this
you were just digging it that someone was listening
sometimes everything sounds like freakin' nonsense
you know what comes out of you when you're drunk.. like immaturity
someone like me ain't good enough for music
someone like me ain't good enough for the truth
someone like me ain't good enough for a calling
someone like me ain't good enough to be a muse
the flaws of mine that i know
maybe that's all i've got really
the world is actually not interested in my clumsiness at all
the regrets that i don't even get sick of anymore
i tumble with them every night until i'm disgusted
and twist the irreversible time habitually
there's something that raised me up again every time
the first question
the three syllables of my name and the word 'but' that should come before any of those
so i'm askin' once again yeah
who the hell am i?
tell me all your names baby
do you wanna die?
oh do you wanna go?
do you wanna fly?
where's your soul? where's your dream?
do you think you're alive?
i don't know man
but i know one thing
my name is r
the 'me' that i remember and people know
the 'me' that i created myself to vent out
yeah maybe i have been deceiving myself
maybe i've been lying
but i'm not embarrassed anymore this is the map of my soul
dear myself
you must never lose your temperature
cuz you don't need to be neither warm nor cold
though i might sometimes be hypocritical or pretend to be evil
this is the barometer of my direction i want to keep
the 'me' that i want myself to be
the 'me' that people want me to be
the 'me' that you love
and the 'me' that i create
the 'me' that's smiling
the me that's sometimes in tears
vividly breathing each second and every moment even now

a little taller than i was before
with a voice a little more solid
all of this to go back to you
now i'll spread wide a map called you
my rehab
look at me, why can't you recognize me?
i don't want to hear other people's noises
your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down
let's go back to that time

baby i know
i can make it better
i can hold you tighter
all those roads
are pointing to you

everything was useless
anything other than you
just touch me like that time

so hurry and grab me quickly

i feel like i'm floating, both eyes spinning
in this fabulous space, i feel completely shabby

totally shabby
the world thinks we own the whole world
even if we have what i wanted in my dreams
big house, big cars, big rings
the unfamiliar feeling of missing something
for someone who has accomplished everything
but i go out the door since i know i have something to return to

i keep remembering you between crossroads
you knew me when i had nothing else
i could smile at the thought of you
the place where you are

one day
will you open the door for me
when the doorbell rings three times
so that i could give the parting words
that i did not finish
i'll tell you then

It seems that I'm like the moon in the midday


If I was only by myself
If I didn't know you
Maybe I'd have given up
Lost at sea


But my heart's still on fire
With a burning desire
Gonna get you back like it's destined


I wish that you would love (Love) me (Me)
Like yesterday, don't let go of this hand ever again
And every time my heart (Heart) beats (Beats)
Match your steps so you don't wander around ever again


I feel destiny in you, you, you, you, you
I feel destiny in me, me, me, me, me


When you hear my heartbeat, baby
You give me a new life, you give me a new birth
I feel your heart beat away
I been losing my mind, I been cravin' my shine
I know me before you was a ready-made me
But you designate me and you resumed me
I been calling your name in this universe
(Now I need no space)
I got youniverse, done


Coming across you is like a TV drama created by the universe (Yeah)
So many wanderings, being lost endlessly
It was you who led me through the labyrinth
You're my light and salvation
The rain is coming close to an end and I won't let go of your hand


I wish that you would love (Love) me (Me)
Like yesterday, don't let go of this hand ever again
And every time my heart (Heart) beats (Beats)
Match your steps so you don't wander around ever again


I feel the destiny in you, you, you, you, you
Feel the destiny in me, me, me, me, me
I feel the destiny in you you you you you
Feel the destiny in me, me, me, me, me


My heart's on fire for your love
Oh, my heart's on fire for your love


I wish that you would love (Love) me (Me)
Just like yesterday, don't let go of this hand ever again
And every time my heart (Heart) beats (Beats)
Match your steps so you don't wander around ever again

A Brand New Day,"Fear and dread
Will I be able to overcome them?


As if hypnotized
Pulled me and led me through
As if in a trance
I became able to listen to the voice inside of me


Though untouchable, the future's fragments are clearly seen

On the day, I found myself
(A brand new day)
Go up the stairs of light
The moment we've dreamt of

Show myself to the world


Oh I can be there, yeah
I'll be there, be there for you, oh


I know you got them big dreams too
You can show me yours if you want to
Theyare beautiful
We can look at them for hours
And surrender to their power, yeah


I see new worlds, these visions
They burn inside of me (inside of me, oh yeah)
Just out of touch
But still close enough to be part of me (part of me)


I'll be there when the day comes
(A brand new day)
Head up in the sunlight, baby
I'll be there when the day comes
When the day comes, I'll be there for you, baby

Show the world just who I can be


Oh yeah, though I was fearful, I didn't lower my head
Though I was dreadful, I just ran ahead
Because I believed in myself even at crossroads of persecution
Going my way, choices that are like mine (I heard)
Voice getting louder, the sound of breathing from happiness
I suddenly realized, I would make my dream come true, haha

Sometimes I ask myself, ""Is this is a dream?""
The darkness before the sunrise seems especially dark
On the other hand, in front of the path that I've walked on
The timing and the right and wrongs

The footsteps we have
Are even compared to the people who have walked in front of us

ÂThanks ToÂ Notes,"so iam not the best at saying things in an organized mannera| but know thataiaalways want toatell you all the beautiful thingsaand do things that will make you feel good. my heart has not changed. it is still here, it has matured, it has grown even bigger. i try to keep my comments short because the longer it gets, the more confused i become. but itas not easy. i really purple you all though
no matter how old i get, i will keep coming back with more love for everyone. i may not be much, but please let me be your pride and joy. i will strive to remain your awesome son, grandson, friend, younger brother, and an older brother who makes you proud

time goes by so diligently. even when everything else comes to a stop, time does not. it keeps going. this is our record that has finally seen light after such a long period. these are the memoirs of our footsteps past. these are the sounds that are frozen in space. and as special as the year 2020 is on its own, i am thrilled to be putting down the seven of our names on the album, with no other words to describe us
every time an album is released, i tend to get emotional. nonetheless, i am grateful that the seven of us have reached a new stage. weave passed through countless dimensions and probabilities to get here. i am thankful that this book has come to be. i am honored to be holding on to this much luck. thank you
i know better now though a that the seven of us are not the only ones standing on the empty stage in the dark. i now see the silhouettes of everyone who has been here with us throughout our history. some of them are tucked low, some are hanging unreachably high. i must say, that is what iave learned after 7 years of running toward the truth
i still donat know all the names of those to whom i owe thanks. i probably canat even write them all down. but i know that these names belong to my family, friends, the members, the agency, all the staff members and associates in the industry, and even to a brief message of encouragement from an unknown face. we all wear different name tags when we meet at different points in our lives, but i know that at this moment, i am able to smile and write this thank you note because of everyone who treated me with love when they crossed paths with me
i know though, there is one final name that deserves to be at the end of this short story. and that name would belong to armys. when i read out the word army, it sounds korean, but at times it also sounds english. sometimes it even sounds spanish. on that name tag, i see the names and faces of all armys around this planet. i fall asleep embracing these names that have come pouring into my arms like falling stars. i shall have a good dream a and i shall find a good vibe to keep going. would this not be what true love looks like? i love you all. thank you. hereas to another record of us

while being able to make an album and have people listen to our songs is a precious and happy thing, iam always thinking of how to make more heartfelt songs that can touch all those that listen to our songs. it is because of this that making an album has a big meaning for us. i want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the efforts and work of the people that helped us create this album
i know that words are not enough to express how thankful i am to bang pd, yoon seok jun and the rest of the big hit entertainment family. i want to show you how much more we can grow just like how much we have grown so far. i am deeply thankful
i am also so sorry and thankful to all the staff and the design team. you sleep less and work harder than us and i know i donat express myself enough. it is because of your efforts that we are able to shine brightly. thank you from the bottom of my heart
to my members. just thank you. i know i shouldnat take you all for granted but i keep thinking itas just natural. i canat imagine not having all of you. so i hope to continue going forward with all of you for a long, long time. i will try my best to do better. thank you so much and i love you
to army. itas already been 7 years since weave been together. i think weave been able to share a lot of happy emotions together by talking about music. although there is happiness that comes from simply being happy, i think happiness that is earned through sharing our feelings is something i am truly grateful for. it is a blessing that i was able to meet all of you. iam really curious to see how many more precious memories we will have together as the years go by. until then, i hope to continue to share this with my members and all of you. lastly, as i said before, having people listen to our music is our biggest happiness. i know i always say this but the reason we exist and are able to sing on stage is because of all you. thank you. i love you

another full album has been released. first of all, iad like to share this honor with our army. if it werenat for all of you, there would be no meaning of us making music. thank you and i love you army
much love to my family who is always by my side and giving me strength
and to the big hit family. now there is more staff that i donat know that i do know but i will never forget the efforts and work of all our staff. i am happy to be able to work with the worldas best staff
to the bts members. preparing for this album was hard work and iam glad that all our efforts werenat wasted because we were able to complete a really amazing album. i am happy to have worked with all of you for this album. letas promote this album well~
i also want to say thank you to all the people who listen to our music. i believe that music that doesnat have people listening to it is incomplete music. thank you for completing our album",en,so iam

Intro: Persona ,"who am i? the question i had my whole life
the question which i probably wonat find an answer to my whole life
if i were answerable with a few more words
then god wouldnat have created all these various beauties
how you feel? howare you feeling right now?
actually iam real good but a little uncomfortable
i'm still not so sure if i'm a dog or a pig or what else
but then other people come out and put the pearl necklace on me
ptui!
i laugh more than i did before
i dreamt of becoming a superhero
now it feels like i really became one
but as it goes on thereas so much blabbering
one says, ""run"" another says, ""stop""
this one says, ""look at the forest"" that one says, ""look at the wild flower""
my shadow, i wrote and called it hesitation
it has never hesitated after becoming that
it keeps appearing under the stage or the light
keeps glaring at me scorchingly like a heat wave (oh shit)
hey, have you already forgotten why you even started this
you were just digging it that someone was listening
sometimes everything sounds like freakin' nonsense
you know what comes out of you when you're drunk.. like immaturity
someone like me ain't good enough for music
someone like me ain't good enough for the truth
someone like me ain't good enough for a calling
someone like me ain't good enough to be a muse
the flaws of mine that i know
maybe that's all i've got really
the world is actually not interested in my clumsiness at all
the regrets that i don't even get sick of anymore
i tumble with them every night until i'm disgusted
and twist the irreversible time habitually
there's something that raised me up again every time
the first question
the three syllables of my name and the word 'but' that should come before any of those
so i'm askin' once again yeah
who the hell am i?
tell me all your names baby
do you wanna die?
oh do you wanna go?
do you wanna fly?
where's your soul? where's your dream?
do you think you're alive?
i don't know man
but i know one thing
my name is r
the 'me' that i remember and people know
the 'me' that i created myself to vent out
yeah maybe i have been deceiving myself
maybe i've been lying
but i'm not embarrassed anymore this is the map of my soul
dear myself
you must never lose your temperature
cuz you don't need to be neither warm nor cold
though i might sometimes be hypocritical or pretend to be evil
this is the barometer of my direction i want to keep
the 'me' that i want myself to be
the 'me' that people want me to be
the 'me' that you love
and the 'me' that i create
the 'me' that's smiling
the me that's sometimes in tears
vividly breathing each second and every moment even now
persona
who the hell am i
i just wanna go
i just wanna fly
i just wanna give you all the voices till i die
i just wanna give you all the shoulders when you cry

Make It Right ,"the moment i noticed myself
i had to leave
i had to find out
all day all night

across the desert and the sea
this wide, wide world
i wandered
baby i

i could make it better
i could hold you tighter
on that long road
oh you're the light
uninvited
unwelcome
the only one who recognized me

this eternal night with no end in sight
it's you who gifted me the morning
can i now hold that hand?
oh oh
i can make it right

all right
all right
oh i can make it right

all right
all right
oh i can make it right

i became a hero in this world
the loud screams that seek me out
my hand, trophy and a gold microphone
all day, everywhere
but all of this is about reaching you
it's the answer to my journey
i'm singing to find you
baby to you

a little taller than i was before
with a voice a little more solid
all of this to go back to you
now i'll spread wide a map called you
my rehab
look at me, why can't you recognize me?
i don't want to hear other people's noises
your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down
let's go back to that time

baby i know
i can make it better
i can hold you tighter
all those roads
are pointing to you

everything was useless
anything other than you
just touch me like that time

this eternal night with no end in sight
it's you who gifted me the morning
now can i hold that hand?
oh oh
i can make it right

all right
all right
oh i can make it right

all right
all right
oh i can make it right

you are still beautiful
just hold me silently like you did that day, that time
the reason i survived in hell
it's for you, it was not for me
if you know, don't hesitate and please save my life
i'm thirsty wandering this desert without you
so hurry and grab me quickly
i know the sea without you is the same as a desert

all right
i can make it better
i can hold you tighter
oh i can make it right

everything was useless
anything other than you

Jamais Vu ,"i think i lost again
you look like you're mad
in a blur, game over over over

if this was a game
i could just load it again
i guess i gotta deal with this, deal with this
real world

it'd be better if it was a game
because it hurts so much
i need to heal my medic
but i'm another star
blame myself since i was imperfect
brake in my head, brake in my step, always
all i wanted was to do well
i wanted to make you smile, damn

please give me a remedy
a remedy to make my heart beat again
(remedy)
what should i do now
please save me, give me another chance
please give me

a remedy, a melody
a memory that will be left just for me
if i stop right now
if i just turn it off, will all be more comfortable?

i'm fine but i'm not fine
i told myself i was used to it
it always hurts like it's the first time

not a good gamer, that's right, you can't control me
it keeps hurting 'cause of trial and error and 50,000-something else
my song lyrics, each gesture
i become afraid of every word, my jamais vu
again, i try to escape as always
but still, you grab me
even as my shadow grows
my life and yours are an equal sign
so my remedy is your remedy

please give me a remedy
a remedy that will make my heart beat again

""re-spect"" means as it sounds, to literally look again and again
look again and again and you'll see faults
but you still want to keep looking, despite of that
you'll need that perfect belief towards someone (ayy, ayy)
so i can't get myself to easily say
the weight and thickness of it is vague
i hope someday i can confidently say it
and mean it when i do, to you and to me, huh

please don't say respect easily, yeah
because even i am not sure, yeah
sometimes i'm scared of myself
what if the weak me is found out

(respect) everybody says it so easily
(respect) though you don't know what it is
(respect) please take a look again
(respect) one time
(respect) two times
(respect) i won't say it easily
(respect) even if i don't know well now
(respect) one day i'll say it
(respect) one time
(respect) oh yeah

what is ""respect""? (what, hyung?)
i don't know, that's why i'm asking, you rascal (oh, i see)
what even is ""respect""?
why is everyone saying it
honestly i can't understand
admiring someone
was it something really that easy?
i still can't understand it
to be honest, there's no need for admiration
when there's not even respect
everyone except you knows people talk shit behind your back
i honestly respect you
you have no intention to respect me so just skip it
respect, i respect you
applause to that pal who speak ill while smiling

(respect respect)
hope all the glory and prosperity seep into your life
(respect respect)
hope the road in front of you is eternally blessed
(respect respect)
money, honor, forward, forward
(respect respect)
yes, i respect you, yeah

Life Goes On ,"I remember
I, I, I remember
Ah, ah
One day, the world stopped
Without any warning
Spring didn't know that it had to wait
Showed up not even a minute late
Streets erased all of footprints
I lie here, fallen to the ground
Time goes by on its own
Without a single apology
It looks like it's going to rain again today
I'm soaked to the bone
Still won't stop
Running faster than that cloud of rain
Thought that would be enough
Guess I'm only human after all
It hurts so bad
This cold that the world gave me
Prompts me to press the dust-covered rewind
Dancing off-beat lying on the ground
Once winter comes, let's exhale a warmer breath
There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment
Hold my hand
To the future, let's run away
Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again
Let me tell you with this song
People say the world has changed
Mh-hm-hm-hm
But thankfully between you and me
Nothing has changed
With the 'annyeong' that we start and finish the day with
Let us thread tomorrow with today (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh-woah)
Stopped for now, but don't hide in the shadow
Only again, daylight will glow
There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment
Hold my hand (Hold it)
To the future, let's run away (Oh, oh, oh)
Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again
I remember

Everyday
It's so frustrating, it's driving me crazy
Feel like it's still day one
Somebody turn back the clock
The entire year got stolen
I'm still in bed
A bloated stomach
It's killin' me slowly, nah
Anyway
I want to leave any way
There's no way
This room is all I have

Suddenly this strange scenery
I'm absorbed by memories
Even the old desks, the changed sunlight
Looks special
I'm little less lonely, nah
Better way
I just found a better way
Sometimes we get to know
Broken is beautiful
My body is light
Fly away
This thing is so surreal
Yeah
Let's go, let me fly to my room
Lower your gaze and zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
This room is too small
Yes, to contain my dream (Yah, yah, yah)
Landing over the bed
This is the safest place
Somehow there's no joy, no sadness, no emotion
It's just me here
Sometimes this room becomes an emotional trash can
It hugs me
They greet me again
The toys in my room, like people
It's as crowded as if we're out of the city
The TV sound
I just have to change my thoughts
This is a journey that only I can enjoy
Delivery food
Fill it up with optimism, I'm full

Blue & Grey ,"Where is my angel?
The end of the day
Someone come and save me, please
A weary sigh of a tiring day
I guess everyone's happy
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey
The meaning of the tears reflected in the mirror
My color hidden with a smile, blue and grey
I don't know where it went wrong
Since my youth, I've had a blue question mark in my head
Maybe that's why I've been living so fiercely
But when I look back, I'm all by myself
That hazy shadow that swallows me up
The blue question mark still exists
Is it anxiety or depression?
How am I so regretful?
Or is it just me, one that loneliness gave birth to
I still don't know, the ferocious blue
I hope I don't erode away, I'll find the exit
I just wanna be happier
To melt the cold me
My hands have reached out countless times
Colorless echo
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
I just wanna be happier
Am I being too greedy?
I felt when I walked on the cold winter streets
The sound of my fast heartbeat breathing
I still feel it
Don't say it's okay
'Cause it's not okay
Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much
On the road I always walk
There is a light that always shines
But today, the scene feels unfamiliar
Is it dull or is it broken?
This lump of metal feels heavy
A grey rhino is approaching
I'm just standing there without focus
I don't feel like myself at this moment
I'm just not scared
I don't believe in a God called conviction
Words like color make me cringe
A vast grey area is way more comfortable
Hundreds of millions of grey facial expressions here
When it rains, it's my world
I dance over this city
On a clear day, bring some fog
On rainy days, we're always together
A toast to all the dust here
I just wanna be happier
Please feel the warmth of my hands
They're not warm, so I need you more
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
In the distant future, when I smile
I'll tell you I did
After secretly sending my words up into the air
Now I fall asleep at dawn, good night",en,where is my angel the end of the day someone come and save me please a weary sigh of a tiring day i guess everyones happy can you look at me cause i am blue and grey the meaning of the tears reflected in the mirror my color hidden with a smile blue and grey i dont know where it went wrong since my youth ive had a blue question mark in my head maybe thats why ive been living so fiercely but when i look back im all by myself that hazy shadow that swallows me up the blue question mark still exists is it anxiety or depression how am i so regretful or is it just me one that loneliness gave birth to i still dont know the ferocious blue i hope i dont erode away ill find the exit i just wanna be happier to melt the cold me my hands have reached out countless times colorless echo oh this ground feels so heavier i am singing by myself i just wanna be happier am i being too greedy i felt when i walked on the cold winter streets the sound of my fast heartbeat breathing i still feel it dont say its okay cause its not okay please dont leave me alone it hurts too much on the road i always walk there is a light that always shines but today the scene feels unfamiliar is it dull or is it broken this lump of metal feels heavy a grey rhino is approaching im just standing there without focus i dont feel like myself at this moment im just not scared i dont believe in a god called conviction words like color make me cringe a vast grey area is way more comfortable hundreds of millions of grey facial expressions here when it rains its my world i dance over this city on a clear day bring some fog on rainy days were always together a toast to all the dust here i just wanna be happier please feel the warmth of my hands theyre not warm so i need you more oh this ground feels so heavier i am singing by myself in the distant future when i smile ill tell you i did after secretly sending my words up into the air now i fall asleep at dawn good night,angel end day someone come save please weary sigh tiring day guess everyones happy look cause blue grey meaning tears reflected mirror color hidden smile blue grey went wrong since youth blue question mark head maybe thats living fiercely look back hazy shadow swallows blue question mark still exists anxiety depression regretful one loneliness gave birth still ferocious blue hope erode away find exit happier melt cold hands reached countless times colorless echo ground feels heavier singing happier greedy felt walked cold winter streets sound fast heartbeat breathing still feel say okay cause okay please leave alone hurts much road always walk light always shines today scene feels unfamiliar dull broken lump metal feels heavy grey rhino approaching standing without focus feel like moment scared believe god called conviction words like color make cringe vast grey area way comfortable hundreds millions grey facial expressions rains world dance city clear day bring fog rainy days always together toast dust happier please feel warmth hands theyre warm need ground feels heavier singing distant future smile tell secretly sending words air fall asleep dawn good night,"{'neg': 0.176, 'neu': 0.576, 'pos': 0.249, 'compound': 0.9271}",0.9271,Positive

No More Dream,"What is your dream? (What is?)
What is your dream? (What is?)
What is your dream? (What is?)
Is your dream just that?


I wanna big house, big cars, and big rings
But actually I don't have any big dreams
Ha, ha, I live so comfortably
Even I donat have any dream, no one says anything
Everyone thinks the same as I am
The completely forgotten childhood that was filled with so many dreams
Don't worry about university, I'll go somewhere even if itas far away
Okay, mom, I'm going to the study room right now

What were you dreaming to become?
Who do you see now in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live one day
Do something
Put your weakness away


Why aren't you saying anything? I thought you said you didn't want to study
You are afraid of dropping out of school, aren't you? See, you're already getting ready for school
Grow up, you are just all talk, you have a glass mentality boy
Stop! Ask yourself, have you ever tried hard?


Hey, what is your dream? (What is?)
Hey, what is your dream? (What is?)
Hey, what is your dream? (What is?)
Is your dream just that?


It's a lie, you such a liar
See me, see me ya, you are a hypocrite
Stop telling me to switch the path, hey, take care of your own business
Please don't force me
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
What is your dream? What is your dream?
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
Is your dream just that? Is your dream only that?

Okay, the boring same day, every day just repeats
Adults and parents cram us with dreams stuck in place
The No. 1 dream job, a government employee?
The dream wasnat forced, a relief pitcher in the bottom of the ninth


Throw a fastball towards self-study that is a waste of time
Disobey the hell of a society, grant a special pardon to your dream
Ask yourself what is your dreamas profile
Become the subject of your own life that's always been suppressed


What were you dreaming to become?
Who do you see now in your mirror, I gotta say
Go your own way
Even if you live one day
Do something
Put your weakness away


Hey, whatas your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Hey, what's your dream?
Is your dream just that?

It's a lie, you such a liar
See me, see me ya, you are a hypocrite
Stop telling me to switch the path, hey, take care of your own business
Please donat force me
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
What is your dream? What is your dream?
(Say) La, la, la, la, la
Is your dream just that? Is your dream only that?


You don't know how to live
You don't know how to fly
You don't know how to decide
Now you don't even know how to dream
Open your eyes, eyes, eyes
Everyone, now dance, dance, dance
Now, dream, dream, dream again
Don't move slowly, don't hesitate, wassup!


It's a lie, you such a liar (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
See me, see me ya, you are a hypocrite
Stop telling me to switch the path, hey, take care of your own business

N.O,"Yo, right in here
BTS, we dropped the second ball
CS, the revolution started again


A good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?
In Seoul to the SKY, would your parents be happy?


Dream is gone, no time to breathe
School, house and PC room is all we have
We live the same life
And have to become number one
For us it's like a double spy between dream and reality

Who is the one who made us into study machines?
It's either number one or a failure
They trap us in borders, the adults
Thereas no choice but to consent
Even if we think simply, itas the survival of the fittest
Who do you think is the one who makes us step on even our close friends to climb up? What?


Adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
To endure a little more, to do it later


Everybody say NO!
It's not going to work anymore
Don't be captured in others dreams
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll
Everybody say NO!
It has to be now
We've done nothing yet
We roll (We roll) We roll (We roll) We roll
Everybody say NO!


A good house, a good car, will these things bring happiness?
In Seoul to the SKY, would your parents be happy?

I want to eat and have fun, I want to tear my uniform
Make money, good money, but they already view me crookedly
My obscure bank account, my unhappiness is past its limit
A factory of sighs while studying, a continuous cycle


Adults say that we have it so easy
They say I'm on my way to happiness
Then how do you explain my unhappiness?
There's no conversation topics other than studying
Outside, there are so many kids like me, living the life of a puppet
Who will take responsibility?


Adults tell me that hardships are only momentary
To endure a little more, to do it later


Everybody say NO!

(Dad) Just how exactly
Did dad ask mom out?
Should I write you a letter?
What is this? I become like dust in front of you


You make me so angry and mad for no reason
I'm serious but you make me into a loser who picks fights with you
Why do I care so much about you?
You're making a big boy act like a little kid
But, I'm going to flip the situation, from friends to lovers


If it's with you, I think I can go to a good college
ABCDEFGH Hakuna Matata
Your profile picture is the same but why do I keep checking it?
But don't misunderstand, I'm not an easy guy


I'm getting nervous, I'm getting nervous
Who are you? Are you that great?
Why do you keep teasing me?
Just stop now, hold up, hold up


Hold me tight before I kiss you
Before my heart lets you go
Say what you want
Say what you want
What is it that you really want?
Hold me tight before I kiss you
Before my heart lets you go
Say what you want
Say what you want
What is it that you really want?

Why are you shaking up my heart?
Why are you shaking up my heart?
Why are you shaking up my heart?
Shaking up
Shaking up


A bad bad girl on the outside
An even more bad bad girl on the side
If you lose a guy like me, you'll regret it
You checked my text message but you're not pressing send
The ""1"" disappears, making me so anxious
Maybe I'll buy a GPS navigation (Quickly quickly quickly)
I keep trying to appeal to you (trying trying trying)
Genuine feelings? (I got em) Endurance? (I got em)
The only thing I don't have is your beauty beauty beauty


How should I change for you? (hold up)
Playing mind games? Two-timing? I don't know how to do that
But if you're ever sick, don't call 911 but call me
Tell me to cry, I'll cry, tell me to smile, I'll smile, tell me to roll around, I'll roll around


I'm getting nervous, I'm getting nervous
Who are you? Are you that great?
Why do you keep teasing me?
Just stop now, hold up, hold up

Hold me tight before I kiss you
Before my heart lets you go
Say what you want
Say what you want
What is it that you really want?
Hold me tight before I kiss you
Before my heart lets you go

Even if you act cold

It's always like this, you are you, I am me
That's your kind of formula
Your cellphone is just an accessory
Am I really your boyfriend? Iam sick of this
Why do you put off your feelings like homework?
Are we doing business? Or do you hate me?
Be more affectionate
Today I put a spell on you again

We're like parallel lines, looking at the same spot but so different
You're the only one I have
But why do I feel like you're not there
You ask me ""Are you mad at me?"" when I'm down
Have you ever done anything to make me down?
You're cute and I'm just pathetic
Hope a miracle happens so that you love me more than I love you


You don't have me, but I'm so full of you
I'm going crazy
So why are you doing this to me?
Why are you making a fool out of me?

I'm trying to find out your real intention
You always send me 1 or 2 lines of text messages
Is this the relationship I've wanted and dreamed of?
Where did all the love stories go?
Get the main characters of TV dramas out of my way
I grab my hair like this hundreds of times
You look calm, you dump me


What am I? What am I? What am I to you?
I always hear your news from your friends
I want you, want you, uh, I want you
You're a swindler, you're a criminal who shook my heart
You used me up before you got caught on fire
My efforts to win your heart were a waste of time
I'm just a friend to you, you seem to like that more
I'm a love loser

"Blood, Sweat & Tears ","My blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance
Take it all away
My blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath
Take it all away
My blood, sweat, and tears


My blood, sweat, and tears
My body, mind, and soul
I know well they're all yours
This is a spell that will punish me
Peaches and cream, sweeter than sweet
Chocolate cheeks and chocolate wings
But your wings are the devil's
There is a bitter next to your sweet
Kiss me, it's okay if it hurts
Just make it as tight
As that I can't feel the pain anymore
Baby, it's okay if I  get drunk
I'll drink you in deep now
Deep into my throat
The whiskey that is you

My blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance
Take it all away
My blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath
Take it all away
Want it more and more
More and more
Want it more and more
More and more, more, more
Want it more and more
More and more
Want it more and more
More and more, more, more


It doesn't matter if it hurts
Tie me up so I can't escape
Hold me tight and shake me up
So that I can't come to my senses
Kiss me on the lips
A secret just between the two of us
Deeply poisoned by the jail of you
I cannot worship anyone but you and I knew
The grail was poisoned but I drank it anyway


My blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance
Take it all away
My blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath
Take it all away
Want it more and more
More and more
Want it more and more
More and more, more, more
Want it more and more
More and more
Want it more and more
More and more, more, more

Kill me softly
Close my eyes with your caress
I can't resist it anyway
I can't even escape anymore
You are too sweet, too sweet

Spring Day,"I miss you
Saying this makes me miss you all even more
I miss you
Even though Iam looking at your photo
Time's so cruel, I hate us
Seeing each other is now more difficult
It's all winter here, even in August
My heart is running on time, alone on the Snowpiercer
I want to go to the other side of Earth, holding your hand, put an end to winter
How much should my longings fall like snow
Before the days of spring return, friend?

Like the tiny dust, tiny dust floating in the air
I could've reached you faster
If I was snow flying in the air


Snowflakes fall down
And fall apart little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
How many nights do I have to pass
To see you? (To see you)
To meet you? (To meet you)


Pass the end of winter's cold
Until the spring day comes again
Until the flowers bloom again
Please stay, please stay there a little longer


Is it you who changed? (Is it you who changed)
Or is it me? (Or is it me)
I hate this moment, this time flowing by
We've changed, you know?
Just like everyone, you know?
Yes, I hate you, you left me
But I never stopped thinking about you, not even a day
I miss you, honestly, but Iall erase you
'Cause it hurts less than to blame you

I try to exhale you in pain
Like smoke, like white smoke
I say that Iall erase you
But I canat really let you go yet


Snowflakes fall down
And fall apart little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many nights do I have to pass
To see you? (To see you)
To meet you? (To meet you)


You know it all, youare my best friend
The morning will come again
No darkness, no season can last forever


Maybe cherries are blossoming
And winter is going to be over
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Wait a little bit, just a few more nights
Iall be there to see you (I'll go there to meet you)

Life Goes On,"I remember
I, I, I remember
Ah, ah


One day, the world stopped
Without any warning
Spring didn't know to wait
Showed up not even a minute late
Streets erased of footprints
I lie here, fallen to the ground
Time goes by on its own
Without a single apology, yeah

It looks like rain again today
I'm soaked to the bone
Still won't stop (Hey)
Running faster than that cloud of rain
Thought that'd be enough
Guess I'm only human after all
I'm in a world of pain
This cold the damn world gave to me (Woo)
Prompts me to press the dust-covered rewind
Dancing off-beat lying on the ground
Once winter comes, let's exhale
A warmer breath


There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment
Hold my hand
To that future, let's run away


Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again

Let me tell you with this song (Ayy)
People say the world has changed (No)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
But thankfully between you and me
Nothing's changed


With the 'annyeong' that we start and finish the day
Let us thread tomorrow with today (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh-woah)
Stopped for now but don't hide in the shadow
Once again daylight will glow


There's no end in sight
Is there a way out?
My feet refuse to move, oh
Close your eyes for a moment (Close it)
Hold my hand (Hold it)
To that future, let's run away (Oh, oh, oh)

Intro: Persona,"Yo


Who am I? The question I had my whole life
The question which I probably wonat find an answer to my whole life
If I were answerable with a few more words
Then God wouldnat have created all these various beauties
How you feel? Howare you feeling right now?
Actually Iam real good but a little uncomfortable
I'm still not so sure if I'm a dog or a pig or what else
But then other people come out and put the pearl necklace on me
Ptui!
I laugh more than I did before
I dreamt of becoming a superhero
Now it feels like I really became one
But as it goes on thereas so much blabbering
One says, ""Run"" another says, ""Stop""
This one says, ""Look at the forest"" that one says, ""Look at the wild flower""

My shadow, I wrote and called it hesitation
It has never hesitated after becoming that
It keeps appearing under the stage or the light
Keeps glaring at me scorchingly like a heat wave (Oh shit)
Hey, have you already forgotten why you even started this
You were just digging it that someone was listening
Sometimes everything sounds like freakin' nonsense
You know what comes out of you when you're drunk.. like immaturity


Someone like me ain't good enough for music
Someone like me ain't good enough for the truth
Someone like me ain't good enough for a calling
Someone like me ain't good enough to be a muse
The flaws of mine that I know
Maybe that's all I've got really
The world is actually not interested in my clumsiness at all
The regrets that I don't even get sick of anymore
I tumble with them every night until I'm disgusted
And twist the irreversible time habitually
There's something that raised me up again every time
The first question
The three syllables of my name and the word 'but' that should come before any of those


So I'm askin' once again yeah
Who the hell am I?
Tell me all your names baby
Do you wanna die?
Oh do you wanna go?
Do you wanna fly?
Where's your soul? where's your dream?
Do you think you're alive?

Ah, shit
I don't know man
But I know one thing


My name is R
The 'me' that I remember and people know
The 'me' that I created myself to vent out
Yeah maybe I have been deceiving myself
Maybe I've been lying
But I'm not embarrassed anymore this is the map of my soul
Dear myself
You must never lose your temperature
Cuz you don't need to be neither warm nor cold
Though I might sometimes be hypocritical or pretend to be evil
This is the barometer of my direction I want to keep
The 'me' that I want myself to be
The 'me' that people want me to be
The 'me' that you love
And the 'me' that I create
The 'me' that's smiling
The me that's sometimes in tears
Vividly breathing each second and every moment even now


Persona
Who the hell am I
I just wanna go
I just wanna fly
I just wanna give you all the voices till I die
I just wanna give you all the shoulders when you cry

Not a good gamer, that's right, you can't control me
It keeps hurting 'cause of trial and error and 50,000-something else

I become afraid of every word, my jamais vu

Trivia: Seesaw ,"it was a good start
the ups and downs, themselves
before i knew it, we grew tired
with meaningless emotional drains
repeated seesaw game
now, i'm so sick of this
repeated seesaw game
we're getting sick and tired of each other
were the petty arguments the start?
the moment i became heavier than you
because there have never been parallels in the first place
maybe it was my greed trying to match myself with you
if it was love, and if this is what love means
is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
we're tired of each other, yet seem to be holding the same cards
well, then
alright, a repeating seesaw game
it's about time we put an end to it
all right, this boring seesaw game
somebody has to get off of it
there's no turning back
let's not measure who will get off first
letas not drag things out
let's follow our hearts
let's put an end to this
this repeated seesaw game
let's end this now
people can be so crafty
we know someone gets hurt if the other is gone
but because we don't want to be the villains
in the midst of a series of vague responsibilities
we became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel
although this wasn't the kind of parallel that i wanted
at first, we showed off who was heavier
we bragged and smiled at each other
now we're trying measure who's heavier
a competition between us
that became a flame, igniting quarrels
itall only end if someone gets off right here
acting like weare comforting each other
with words mixed with thorns
canat keep doing this, we need to make a decision
if we didnat have feelings for each other
if we didnat think of each other
would we have dragged it out like this?
now if you donat have any more feelings
this seesaw is dangerous
stop thinking about me

I'm better than ya lazy
Rather than those who do hip-hop through the keyboard
I live a hundred times harder
They look at rap easily genre, too many generals
Uncertain, ambiguous all of them have some manners
Those who can't even continue on one verse
Because they try to discuss rap or music
That's why here they all still rap the same way like this
Only three or two words, They're all critical patients
Mother-father Aphasic patient all just con artist
Back yourself and look at the mirror
If you want to be a piece, make it an original
Just try something suckas the sincerity in this is zero
I got by the name of Monster welcome to the monster plaza
This a cypher I'm a rider imma ride it like a biker
Oh shit slip it backwards beat
You're a drain and I feel content
The kids whose skills are on strike
Do so much protest behind my back
Man what you afraid of, I'm confident on top of the beat
You're a beggar, from your pocket to the skills you don't have, you're poor
I don't need GIVENCHY cause I'm a star
I don't need HUGO already a boss
I'm not Buddha but I'm a butcher I cut away your flesh like a
Change your iPhone
You donat need your airplane mode
My roaming fees are hundreds of dollars
And you know I can take it more
Make money with rocks, sell rocks, you frauds
San Paulo to Stockholm, Places you'll never sit in your entire life I sit

Haters I have a lot but no problem, I kill
The shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
Bitch I don't care, You can't control my shit
I became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again


This fourth albums focus point cypher
When this track comes out haters will totally turn from the worse
On this scene that's about illegal things
This songs legality will make everyone fall into a trap
Hang hang over bang
Explode and come out Swag
Whenever I go, I drive straight
And wherever I go, it's there the losers of hip-hop
They're at a different proportion of levels to be cussing at me
Busy by my talking has come, all unnies call me Beep Beep
Someone's cussing at me
Tell them to look at their own situation and then come to me
I don't have anything to be jealous of about others
Oh on top of the beat beat I wiggle wiggling jingle jingling
I roll, roll around, Act like a beagle, then I start to burn up
Strength right now right now
Ruling over on top of the on top of the ring
A king who will surpass the name of a god
This is just a sample, just a snack
My rap will soon be a Korean meal to fill your stomach
That's right, my nation Korea
All the rap Mansiks' trying to spit out poor English
Look at who's on top of you now


Haters I have a lot but no problem, I kill
The shovels digging on my career in order to bury me
Bitch I don't care, You can't control my shit
I became a ninja who has endured distrust and returned again


S-U-G-A a.k.a Agust D, My second name
When I walk in the streets, they whisper my name
From Daegu to Apgujeong my beat that have been laid
The lives of my music that breath and live here and there all over the world
Iam a baby shaman who dances on the jakdu called the beat, thatas me
My self that is shown through the TV
Did you know that half of it is a kagemusha?
You're all just big talk with your mouth, but that's rapping
The spirit of my heavy king rap that hits towards the lies of the solicit nompaengis
Rappers who act arrogant
My flow job that takes them all and toys around with them
If you try to damage me with simple words like that
I only become stronger
The mysterious me is a bulgasari who grows by eating your jealousy and envy
Like you all know my voice turns people on
Whether it be men or women
My flexible tongue movements will send them to Hong Kong with my raps
On top of the food chain
I'm always on the highest point of the summit
My idiocy that won't end
Even if someone tries to try to fuck me over from the back
While you guys play around
We're going around the world
Hyungnims who gained age carelessly
From my standards, you're at the level of a kid too
Even if I'm wack or if I'm fake if I'm this or that
I'm the new standard of the music industry
This rap will throw a slap an endless slap at their ears chop chop chop

Haters I have a lot but no problem, I kill

I go back every day
Toame of yesterday
To the life of giving up
I let myself go away
But in this world, you know
There are truths unchanged
Time rushes ever forward
There's no ifs, buts, or maybes
Almost forgotten memories return
Touch of the devil, fateful recall
I still wonder, why did they beckon again
Every day ask me, guess it, whip it, repeat oh
Nothing that will change, so
I lock it up again, close
How much love? How much joy?
Soothe myself and stay calm, alone

Yeah, I don't care, it's all

And dress up to mask on

To become the one you love

Tick aatock the dark is over
To be your best again
Grab myself
Love makes people crazy
Yeah
I will assign it to the best expression
Give me the answers I gave you for all of you

Why the hell? I ran so hard, oh, why to me?

Come home and lie in bed
Thinking if it was my fault?
Dizzy night, looking at the clock
Soon it will be midnight


Will something be different?
It won't be something like that
But this day will be over
When the minute and second hands overlap
The world holds its breath for a little while
Zero o'clock


(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy
Like that snow that just settled down
Let's breathe, like the first time
(Ooh-ooh) And you're gonna be happy

When everything is new, zero o' clock


The beat slips away little by little
I can't put on an easy face
I keep forgetting familiar lyrics
There's nothing going my way
Yes, it's all in the past
Even talking to myself, it's not easy
Is it my fault? Is it my wrong?
Only my echo comes back with no answer

Come home and lie in bed
Thinking if it was my fault?
Dizzy night, looking at the clock
Soon it will be midnight

Quotation Mark,"If I die, I'll probably go to hell because I lie to more than a dozen times a day, uh

That's why I can't be honest
In a way, I might be your stalker, or maybe your investigator
My heart is a precious jewel
This kind of heart was supposed to be stolen by you anyway

Even if I forget you and rip you apart and wash you

Ever since the day I met you, I was full of regrets, and I was so angry at what I couldn't say (Ah-ah)
My feelings are not a box, so why do I keep closing it?
At night I kick off my blanket, turning into a devil that wants to have you
When will it be? I'll keep fighting with myself
Today, I'll cast my heart away before I unwind in your booth
I hope so, and I move on, but when I stand in front of you, I lose
I want you so badly, please, it's already my wish, oh, my genie, huh
Do she love me? Do, do she love me?
Not this fear from cold froze my lips

In the meantime, a ray of light (A ray of light)
I'm really glad it's you
We shine because we are together


Running
Falling again
Get myself up
Falling down, oh
Would you give me your hand
How many times will it happen
If you are tired, you can rest awhile (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm always here, waiting for you
*Daydreamin' 'bout us facin'
Really don't wanna say it, but*

If I never met you
Oh, what am I like, baby
Every time I miss you (Miss you)
Those words that have became a habit
(It's so true)
You're my best friend
For the rest of my life
I wish I could turn back time
